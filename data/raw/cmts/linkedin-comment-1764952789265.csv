A few points stand out:
1. UPI as infrastructure, not just a product: 654 million transactions daily is not a number, it’s a massive behavior shift. It’s proof that seamless, reliable infrastructure drives adoption faster than any marketing push.
2. Cross-border integration: Enabling links with countries like France, Singapore, and UAE is a textbook example of turning domestic success into global influence without reinventing the wheel.
3. Democratization of finance: Platforms like Zerodha, Groww, Lendingkart, and Slice are doing more than transactions they’re bringing financial literacy and inclusion at scale, creating the base for a robust domestic capital market.
4. Fintech + impact: Companies like Aerem show that fintech isn’t limited to payments or loans it can enable sustainability, SME growth, and social impact while remaining commercially viable.

At Niru Capital, we’re building an investment firm inspired by Berkshire Hathaway — investing in high-potential early-stage startups and public equities with a long-term compounding mindset.
