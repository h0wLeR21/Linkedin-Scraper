I noticed when founders build from lived experience/ depth, it often shows up in the maturity of their solution.","2025-09-10T10:48:49.539Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371081095045410816,7371494856491347968)","1","No","Yes"

"Ramkumar","R S","Ramkumar R S","https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations","milliGOLD | RSR Innovations","comment","Long ago at Murugappa Group we were trained by Mercuri Goldman on Capital Equipment selling - and there was this ""fox hunting"" method of mapping gate keepers, influencers, users and decision makers and their relative outlook towards you and the competition and then using them to champion your cause - worked very well for us in large organizations and public sector enterprises.

It is long gestation process (we work the relationship over 3-5 years before we land an order, from creating a need to writing the tender specs). Precisely why startups should stay away, because you don't have such a luxury of years from planting teak and harvesting later.","2025-09-09T07:39:04.252Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371081095045410816,7371084715266596865)","2","No","Yes"

Luckily for me, I was able to work with them when they moved to different organisations. Bless them for this. 

The most appealing part - when Founders are solving problems they've faced during their careers. I am working on solving - the biggest one to my knowledge is Closure, Client Retention.","2025-09-09T07:37:55.613Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371081095045410816,7371084427373981696)","1","No","Yes"
