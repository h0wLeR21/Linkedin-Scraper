It’s been months of pushing over one idea / offer and another and not finding a new idea to be part of and while I am well-paced at saying yes / no - in some cases Yes’ and No’s are in the pipeline. 

And usually when I don’t hear from someone I write to them to give me a clear response as that’s the right way to close a conversation. No bad feelings really! 

Thank you for this post. Gonna close on these pending right away. Should make for a lighter weekend 😜","2025-09-12T19:55:05.603Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7372157787964960768,7372357104994619392)","0","No","No"

Lingering may feel polite, but it’s actually the opposite.

So he can stop wasting time chasing me or other investors and rather focus on Growing the business.

Thinking in these extremes is what ""transactional sales people"" often do - and they should - because that is their job. 

Whereas for  a person who is responsible for marketing and product management it is much more complex.

Like Mathematicians would say, there is a multi dimensional solution space with a definite path from No and May be to Yes and Action with a deep valley of indifferent silence in between.  And that path passes through your product, its alternatives, messaging and many unconscious subconscious emotions which the customer herself is not aware of.","2025-09-12T09:52:14.524Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7372157787964960768,7372205392493252608)","1","No","Yes"

There a large deal that has been in the works for some time now & the principal promoter of the company wants to do the deal & his team is not on the same side.
