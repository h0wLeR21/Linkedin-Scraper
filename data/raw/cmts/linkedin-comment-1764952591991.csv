Will you have pricing power - not because customers love your brand like apple or nike, but because they don't have a choice.

You just have to be clear why you are building and for whom you are building.","2025-11-01T06:26:09.063Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7390256503946907648,7390272921274937344)","1","No","Yes"
