How do the VCs understand if the tech will work out if the business case is solid if they don’t understand if the tech works?","2025-10-30T17:59:01.473Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7389536436208922624,7389722512865206274)","2","No","Yes"

Many approach investors as if they’re submitting a grant proposal focused on data, hypotheses, and long-term potential instead of communicating like business leaders.
Investors don’t fund exploration; they fund execution. What separates the ones who get a “yes” is clarity, on how the science translates into value distribution, cost advantage, and scalability.
In my experience, the turning point often comes when founders start thinking like storytellers, not scientists. The story isn’t about what’s in the lab, it’s about how that science moves through the market and impacts lives. That’s when the conversation changes completely.","2025-10-30T08:47:41.481Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7389536436208922624,7389583765322321920)","1","No","Yes"

Legacy. | Helping Founders Build Smarter With Tech, Marketing & Capital","comment","Avik, founders in deep tech forget that capital isn’t awarded for intellectual curiosity, it’s rewarded for commercial clarity.
The market doesn’t care about how long it takes to solve a problem; it cares about when the solution starts compounding returns.
Science discovers truths. Business builds distribution for them. The few who bridge both end up owning the category.","2025-10-30T07:09:26.082Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7389536436208922624,7389559038226685953)","1","No","Yes"

Many founders in deeptech or biotech underestimate how critical “go-to-market clarity” is, even more than scientific depth.","2025-10-30T06:09:13.682Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7389536436208922624,7389543886722949120)","1","No","Yes"
