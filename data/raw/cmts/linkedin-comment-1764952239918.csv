That’s dangerous myopia.

If LPs only chase liquid, listed upside, who funds the next wave of Indian category-creators before they become listed giants?

If we’re serious about India’s innovation story, we need to make early-stage risk capital structurally attractive:
- Tax incentives / pass-through benefits for LPs backing regulated VC funds
- Clearer, faster regulations around AIFs and exits
- A coordinated push from Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA) + founder-led associations to get this on the policy agenda

Otherwise, we drift toward a world where early-stage founders are told:
“Bootstrap, take debt, or don’t build.”

That’s not how you build the next generation of Indian unicorns — that’s how you miss them.","2025-11-21T10:15:58.581Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7397535527647928321,7397578516017352704)","1","No","Yes"

I am not sure if long fund cycles specially the 20 year ones seem an Indian problem. eg: ecom did not exists in India then. And that being said, for newer or emerging managers incl me, it’s both good and bad news","2025-11-21T08:33:34.193Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7397535527647928321,7397552744586395648)","3","No","Yes"
