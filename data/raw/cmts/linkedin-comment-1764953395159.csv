I mean a lot of businesses are such in nature they take time but they bring revolution. Many a times external people (than the founders) can't visualize the change. 

For example if someone would say in 1990 that there will be a mobile phone and you can do banking with it people would laugh. 

VCs enter into a business which has reached a basic stability. The business should not be just the founders. The business should have paying customers etc. Also VCs are also hedging other's money so they need to mitigate high risky investments. 

For all these reasons Founder Market Fit is very very important.","2025-09-05T17:29:48.382Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7369621451999485957,7369783827264651264)","2","No","No"

In food and beverages, I’ve seen brilliant ideas collapse simply because the founder didn’t know how deeply entrenched trust, credit cycles, and supply networks are in India. You can’t shortcut that kind of knowledge. The first time you build, familiar ground gives you more than customers... it gives you instinct. And instinct is what saves you when spreadsheets can’t.","2025-09-05T14:46:44.999Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7369621451999485957,7369742792782184449)","1","No","Yes"

I worked for sports in India for almost a decade. Very fulfilling but failed badly. 

What's also critical is to understand which game ( sector ) one is into. 

If the market needs a long standing game one should refrain from raising external monies ( external money comes with a timer ~ 7 to 8 years) 

Or raise money from folks in the game of patience capital & formidable belief in the sector. 

Ignoring this is often suicidal.","2025-09-05T09:01:06.308Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7369621451999485957,7369655808403361798)","1","No","Yes"

The external capital filter is key here though. While I do believe in the human potential and learning capability, but the oppportunity cost is too high when being a 1st time founder in a non-familiar space. 
Having said that, in my experience founders with extremely quick adaptability and laser sharp execution may overcome this but to build investment confidence the early signs will probably be missing and these are rare founders mind you. 
Anyone can build and sell anything but external capital needs more proof than I can do this and I got this.","2025-09-05T08:50:05.814Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7369621451999485957,7369653038090747911)","1","No","Yes"

Some of the most disruptive companies were built by founders with no prior experience in the industry — precisely because they weren’t bound by legacy thinking.
If everyone only built in spaces they knew well, we’d never see true innovation.
Yes, India is a tough market. Trust deficits, payment cycles, hiring — all real challenges.
 But those are execution problems, not vision problems.
An outsider with a fresh perspective + relentless learning can often spot opportunities that insiders are too used to overlook.
Founder-market fit matters, but so does founder-market un-bias.
 Sometimes, being “unfamiliar” is your biggest advantage. ","2025-09-05T07:12:03.492Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7369621451999485957,7369628365844144130)","4","No","Yes"
