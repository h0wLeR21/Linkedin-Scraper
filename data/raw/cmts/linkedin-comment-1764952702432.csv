Love how you framed it as Revenue vs Story — basically, if you don’t have one, you’d better have the other (and no, passion alone doesn’t count).

It's astonishing to see how many folks reach out without even a look at the company website, thesis, or even the profile of the person you're talking to. 

In today's world of AI, it's so easy to learn anything, literally. You just need to be curious enough. When someone reaches out and asks the most basic things, it just gives lazy. They want to be spoonfed - instead, have an opinion and utilize your connection with people from the industry to share their thoughts and opinions, that's what keeps people interested in you.","2025-10-16T07:30:04.605Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7384457317427245056,7384490802850258945)","1","No","Yes"

Logically, this is how it should be & that's how I'd always imagined fundraising would look like. 
Then you have anomalies like the rush of brands going the Thrasio way, who raised some gob-smacking amounts with just the idea. Gets you to think if the system can be played. ","2025-10-16T05:23:33.500Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7384457317427245056,7384458963448401920)","1","No","Yes"
