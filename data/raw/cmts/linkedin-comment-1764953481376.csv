Unless users are miraculously comfortable paying $1k for the AI app, the only thing propping up  AI is VC funding . No VC funding and the AI application layer is unprofitable, LLM layer is unprofitable, compute layer is unprofitable and the GPU layer is unsustainable. 

Although inference cost is dropping exponentially (which would mean the cost of compute to LLMs like OpenAI and by extension to the AI apps like cursor drops too), if the user is not able to pay the breakeven price for this entire stack (GPU, Hyperscaler cloud margins, LLM margins and wrapper margins), the whole game could implode :)","2025-08-31T08:36:59.019Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7367415245587296256,7367837798705369088)","0","No","No"

We need to improve small models and medium scale models. There are technologies like bitnet which quantize regular 32 bit models to 1 bit llms. This results in increase of speed and decrease in resources to train and run the models.

Why do we need a model which has multiple agents when my application needs only 2-3 agents of that model ? Isnt it waste of resources ?","2025-08-30T17:37:25.031Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7367415245587296256,7367611415391600640)","0","No","No"
