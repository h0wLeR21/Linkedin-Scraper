I’ve seen monthly updates spark interest from investors who weren’t ready initially.

Early-stage founders often think persistence alone changes fund mandates, but understanding the VC’s focus and fund mandate is equally important. If Founders understood VC economics, it would save so much of time on either side. ","2025-08-22T05:36:08.396Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7364186400973340673,7364530797103472641)","1","No","Yes"
