Success is never linear. Knowing gaps, calling your customers, and riding bleak moments is real skill.

(Especially hard when you explain your tech product to  the vc <CA, plus MBA or CFA, never actually built a Co. >  and he she gives a  blank expression or nods like he understands but asks revenue questions immediately)
 Next I would say Luck then team .","2025-11-28T15:31:01.781Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7400032445850513409,7400194516839804928)","1","No","Yes"

Everyone today has commitments, bills, and expectations. Most great talent wants market salaries from day one, but earlystage startups run on conviction long before cash flow. That gap b/w belief and bank balance  is where many founders get crushed.

Finding people who can think like owners, not employees, who’ll build the foundations before the rewards show up… that's the rarest resource in today’s ecosystem. Tech can be learned, distribution can be hacked  but aligning a team that shares the same obsession as the founder is where most SaaS dreams stall....

Sometimes I feel building the product is the easy part; building the team is the real startup...😮‍💨","2025-11-28T08:30:10.134Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7400032445850513409,7400088603755986945)","1","No","Yes"

We often reverse-engineer successful case studies as if they were pure strategic genius, ignoring the massive role of 'Right Place, Right Time.' Acknowledging luck isn't discounting hard work; it's a sign of intellectual honesty.
