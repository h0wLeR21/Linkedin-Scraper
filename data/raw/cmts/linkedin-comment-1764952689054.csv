I hate excels, or sitting on desk! Haaate.

So I usually let my colleague do the whole updating tasks while I manage the outdoorsy stints! 😅","2025-10-29T04:57:57.309Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7389163562448863232)","1","No","Yes"

No one could give satisfactory response. The professor said, “your child is the best negotiator!”","2025-10-27T17:02:32.044Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388621132968579073)","1","No","Yes"

Also, at times, I've seen, if the other party is just not budging, it may be a good idea to introduce a new persona on the negotiating table. Somehow, same points, coming from an unfamiliar place, tend to make a lot more sense to the other party :) ","2025-10-27T09:10:59.449Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388502465232474112)","1","No","Yes"

Most people think negotiation is all about getting what you want only. 
I believe it is like a collaborative what other want try to understand it and find out how both come to the point both people win together. ","2025-10-27T07:38:43.191Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388479244483452928)","1","No","Yes"

The “win together” mindset is spot on — it’s the essence of long-term relationship building, whether in VC, startups, or life.
