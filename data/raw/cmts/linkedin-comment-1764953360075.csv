We’ve managed to redefine the risk with IVB, where the time and money already being spent on education, is instead spent on education + entrepreneurship

Our students get a low risk chance, where if their business fails, they can opt for the safety net of placements","2025-09-24T04:16:58.964Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7376469676106764289)","1","No","Yes"

I did it straight after college, with moderate success, and again mid career. Now I've got to rebuild the runway, but my mind is already at, how long do I need? But when you look at it logically,  and at 40, the goal is really comfortable retirement and that doesn't come with risky ventures.","2025-09-18T05:49:14.873Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7374318568198500353)","1","No","Yes"

You can survive an average product with strong distribution, but not the other way around. Too many ventures die not because they built the wrong thing, but because they couldn’t get it into enough hands.","2025-09-11T07:12:13.519Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7371802735098171392)","0","No","No"

In a decade of angel investing, I’ve seen optimism fuel ambition and cloud judgment. Too many founders underestimate the emotional grind and financial toll of building from scratch. The strongest entrepreneurs plan smart, build support systems, and know when to pivot. Entrepreneurship isn’t a leap—it’s a long, relentless climb.","2025-09-10T20:22:38.845Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7371639263467094016)","1","No","Yes"

Emotional runway is just as important as financial runway. Everyone talks about saving 12–18 months of cash before making the leap. But no one warns you about the mental toll of waking up every day to uncertainty, rejection, and the quiet fear that maybe this won’t work.
It’s not just your money on the line..... it’s your identity, your confidence, your sleep, your relationships.","2025-09-10T16:16:14.805Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7371577254704775168)","1","No","Yes"

But here’s the uncomfortable truth: timing your plunge is a myth. Early, mid, or late career — you’ll never feel “ready.” The only thing you can actually control is your reset plan. How fast can you bounce back if you fail? That’s the real test.","2025-09-10T14:58:38.269Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7371441358819004416,7371557723781386240)","1","No","Yes"
