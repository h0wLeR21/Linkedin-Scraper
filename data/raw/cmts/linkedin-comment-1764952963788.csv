It’s a great investment tool for revenue growth prospects.

Corporate finance teams should levy in-house lending rates if business teams wants to utilize this cashflow. For any revenue projection purposes, such lending rates can be used for discounting future cash flows as well and then ascertain IRR on it.","2025-09-27T06:47:38.813Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7377200018052739072,7377594755578281984)","2","No","No"

Nice rant. Talk Gratis It;s Friday (TGIF). 
Revenue Recognition and Sinking Funds for Contingencies is not part of usual startup lingo. My ex-employer actually got Sarbox certified.
PwC used to red-flag our recognizing an (Order recd, Goods delivered, Delivery Challans signed, Bill raised & Payment recd, AMC period started) situation as revenue because the customer wanted us to store the goods (customer had even taken an insurance policy).

For sectors dependent on bank debt for working capital or term loans, often the headline YTD revenues is an important metric for decision making. Similarly, for capital raising purposes, the YTD revenues (based on invoicing) flows into ARR calculations (though on deep dive, the true picture get uncovered). I recommend that one should show two sets of financials - 1) based on invoicing and 2) based on amortization of revenues and expenses over the year to give a complete picture.","2025-09-26T05:17:34.362Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7377200018052739072,7377209699806408704)","1","No","Yes"
