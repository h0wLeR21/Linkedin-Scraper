Even more so in professions where maintaining relationships is absolutely vital. Although it does surprise me that people fall for these, paying money to the people who are actually giving you the money.

I approached the person and after a few telephone calls he said the UK investor is willing to invest 2 MN pounds into our business. The next day he sends me a SWIFT code for 1 MN pounds. I asked my banker to check the code and verify it. Unfortunately the banker failed miserably. On top of that the banker received telephone calls from the SWIFT transferring bank asking them to pay some transfer charges. I received simultaneous calls from my banker as well as the person with whom I interacted in the first place to get investors. I ended up shelling Rs. 80,000/- by depositing cash in the bank account as requested by this person. My banker too asked me to pay because he was expecting a big deposit through the SWIFT. The entire thing was a hoax / scam. I read many articles here and other social media about hoax, scams, government schemes. I wonder how many of those making these posts have had first hand experience like me.","2025-08-30T12:14:16.558Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7367062699916066816,7367530094241730561)","1","No","Yes"
