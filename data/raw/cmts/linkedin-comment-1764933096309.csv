However have experienced similar operational issues, such as frustating experience of buying through the website where I made the payment, but my order was not reflected due to a half-implemented quick checkout, and post that waiting for the delivery for 20 days, caling 10 times and hanging up everytime with the empty promise that they will call and tell me when it will be delivered.

Sometimes the smartest move isn’t recovering the product, it’s recovering the relationship.

Kudos to The Sleep Company though. In a sleep-deprived nation like ours, solving for that is a huge value unlock. ","2025-12-02T08:00:44.523Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7401510443384782848,7401530749709004800)","1","No","Yes"

One thought that may unlock a new revenue stream...

In Tier-2 and Tier-3 India, a large percentage of households don’t use standard bed sizes they either buy custom cots or get them made by local carpenters. This often creates a psychological friction for premium mattress buyers because they feel 'standard' mattresses may not perfectly fit.

If The Sleep Company introduced a ""Custom fit Program"" ..where a visit / measurement support / or a ₹xxx voucher for local cot resizing is bundled with the mattress purchase it eliminates this barrier completely. 

Mattress purchase would move from product choice to #homefitsolution. That single shift can increase conversion rates dramatically, especially in markets where disposable income is growing but customization mindset is high.....

Just a thought that might accelerate penetration beyond the metros. hope this adds value.....","2025-12-02T07:36:49.668Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7401510443384782848,7401524731491082240)","1","No","Yes"
