Folks will ignore the 20 yr stories n pick the 8-10 yr IPOs n quote Groww and UC instead and consider them as standard.

People talk to me abt Nvidia today as if it was a company born yesterday - ask Jensen how it felt when it traded for practically nothing for 25 yrs before the boom over the last few. 

but no - to most, Nvidia was born yesterday.","2025-11-19T09:17:15.201Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7396755700233723904,7396838962155286528)","2","No","No"

It reminds me of something I keep coming back to 
""The Hardest part is not the start of the finish line- it's the long quite middle 
where you keep showing up with no applause or guarantees.
That's where you're doing the unglamorous work day after day, not knowing if 
any of it will compound.
We massively underestimate how much volume of work , and how much faith in 
the work , it actually takes to build something real.","2025-11-19T06:52:09.507Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7396755700233723904,7396802447828119552)","1","No","Yes"

The public only sees the IPO bell, not the 10–15 years of surviving cash crunches, pivots, failed products and brutal cycles.

I keep telling younger founders & employees that the market rewards durability, not velocity. And ESOPs also follow the same rule: they create wealth only when the business compounds, not when the stock simply lists.","2025-11-19T05:11:48.100Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7396755700233723904,7396777192216576000)","1","No","Yes"
