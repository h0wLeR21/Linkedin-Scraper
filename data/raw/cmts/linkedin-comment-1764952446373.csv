The problem is with those who claim to back early-stage startups,  at idea stage, MVP, even pre-revenue  and proudly list their “thesis sectors"" but then reject founders saying they need more traction or min x MRR/ARR.
That disconnect is what frustrates most founders. If you’re not actually doing early-stage bets, just don’t market it that way. It saves everyone time, expectation, and honestly, a lot of unnecessary heartburn.","2025-12-03T09:06:47.770Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7394234253301035008,7401909760641544193)","6","No","Yes"

Why not turn your deck into a working product? Easier to pitch investors and potential clients by showing them your product vs selling an idea. (Which is what we do 😎)

A very interesting point you made “We're on the lookout too, and we post what we look for.” For most looking for funding this is an important filter to save all the exasperation later.","2025-11-13T08:06:29.463Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7394234253301035008,7394646827049861120)","1","No","Yes"

Curious to know if there are retrospective meetings later on if someone missed a 100X or 1000X return. Like some players in sports don’t get drafted and find a team later - and become superstars. But just wondering if there are retrospective meetings later as a protocol? Because it is all good saying we will do A number for Stage 1 and B number for Stage 2 - but surely it also depends on the situations - like you see a 1000X potential but have already capped for that stage. Just curious 🧐","2025-11-13T00:08:24.469Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7394234253301035008,7394526513464958976)","4","No","No"

Just curious.

That's straight up misbranding and/or misaligned expectations. Something investors in the US don't do as far as I'm aware","2025-11-12T06:25:37.426Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7394234253301035008,7394259055097151488)","2","No","No"
