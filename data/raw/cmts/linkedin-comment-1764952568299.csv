The biggest gap I find is new startups missing in the sector that requires large investment or requires immense hardwork like say manufacturing. I might be wrong here. 

With Shark Tank giving the startups required visibility, we should start seeing more businesses from the tier 2, tier 3 areas coming into the limelight.

And the biggest segment where startups are required is: agriculture. Agriculture should be brought in the limelight, encourage youngsters to take up farming, cost reduction and increase in revenue per acre should give relief to farmer parents on the future.

Also, sharing stories via “Pitch Please”","comment","Pfft… India has always been an entrepreneurial society, going back centuries. Our consumption has been internal for most of the part, and that’s also natural given the population and consumption size. It’s etched into our fabric, our genetics (if I may go there), however, due to the neoliberal ideology and policies, we were pitted against each other, forced to “be in line” and “follow instructions” while our whole being cried for adventure. 

The new 2.0 version of businesses and entrepreneurs is just more aligned with the global economy than just domestic, which is why IPOs/M&A, etc., determine how much money will be poured into the markets.","2025-11-03T09:44:34.986Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7390975265792876544,7391047634062405632)","1","No","Yes"

Rightly so. This is how you ignite dreams in people. 
The flip side is that for every successful startup, there are perhaps 100 that failed.This is a side that does not get much attention or eyeballs. 
There's enough gospel online on how difficult it is to start something on your own. But no one talks about what one can do when a start-up fails. There's space there for guidance, coaching & more exposure. What say Avik Ashar?","2025-11-03T06:35:17.327Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7390975265792876544,7390999996587966464)","1","No","Yes"

"Ramkumar","R S","Ramkumar R S","https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations","milliGOLD | RSR Innovations","comment","I recall a shark tank video where an entrepreneur talks about how they place customer's money (saved for buying jewellery) in P2P platrms to give better returns to customers and all the judges (except one) highlight the financial risk,  legal, moral and ethical dangers of playing with mass market customer's money - not an educated financial investor - on the basis of fine print terms. The startup still gets a deal from the remaining one judge.

Now I hear news (post by Jayant Mundhra) about how OYO is issuing bonus shares where most retail shareholders may not do all the complex things required to get what they truly deserve (default option being a lopsided bonus ratio)

I wonder what kind of examples we are setting in the public imagination.","2025-11-03T06:04:37.767Z","Yes","urn:li:comment:(activity:7390975265792876544,7390992280918274048)","0","No","No"

No kidding. Being the eternal pessimist I think we need to also taper and tone it down to bring forth the reality of swear and blood and tears that go into being a founder AND an investor chasing an LP. we often end up glamourising hardwork. Most folks I meet horrify the crap out of me, very few sensible ones who understand fiduciary responsibility. An aerospace founder I met recently legit pays himself a 50 lakhs a year salary because why not while he struggles with runway every 6-8 months.","2025-11-03T05:19:00.498Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7390975265792876544,7390980799975690240)","1","No","Yes"
