In mumbai itself - the wage gap between Nariman Point and Andheri is large, and even larger between Andheri and Vasai - Virar. This is just a distance of 30 - 40 kms for each pair. It is because the old money is concentrated in such centers, and as far as I understand - tax incentives won't cut it for them. The ecosystem is anchored to this wealth. And to change the urban density - this money needs to move out. So called real estate mafias - they have been developing distance suburbs of Mumbai for almost 2 decades now.

Still, Mumbai has done a much better job in the last 10-15 years in bridging this gap, and a lot of large offices have moved to suburbs from south bombay. And considering Navi Mumbai was set up to ease the burden on Mumbai - it's limited success makes the transition look very slow and virtually ineffective.

This wage gap looks particularly painful in the context of the rising ambition of the young population, and thus the large migration towards mega urban centers. Bridge the gap, and most likely people will stay out of the mega urban centers. That needs something much more than just government incentives.","2025-11-27T05:13:16.677Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7393932427485818880,7399676666660323328)","1","No","Yes"

It enables diverse growth across different parts of the state. More than the tax and grant incentives, companies should show willingness to start first. The government should incentivise these companies who help create the ecosystem by offering the required benefits. 

When you go to the people in Tier 2 and 3 cities or towns, you help the agriculture space also for the younger generation will have time to take up helping the older generation in farming and also work.

What really needs to happen is ecosystem design. Smaller cities probably need three things before talent and companies move:
a.) World-class digital and physical infrastructure: stable internet, reliable power, efficient intra-city transport.
b.) Anchor institutions: universities, startups, and one or two super large employers that attract ancillary businesses.
c.) Cultural capital: schools, healthcare, art, cafes, housing - the softer parts of urban life that make people want to stay.

Once that foundation is built, economic gravity will do the rest. Otherwise, every “new hub” just becomes another expensive metro in five years.","2025-11-11T09:30:02.096Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7393932427485818880,7393943075821322240)","1","No","Yes"

Totally support industries moving to other cities. There's the opportunity to build the whole ecosystem there. 

The flip side being, those places will also start seeing crumbling infrastructure, bad roads, increase in living expenses etc. The charm of smaller cities is that they are not crowded. And we go there to enjoy that.
