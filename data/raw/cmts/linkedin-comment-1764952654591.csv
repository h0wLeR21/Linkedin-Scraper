Instead of helping customers see the value of the product, they are happy to diminish the worth of their product and brand.
 
Let me share the exact words of one of the founders I recently encountered. He said, ""I want only rich and premium people to buy our product, it should have a luxury vibe........ and yes, let's give a 30% discount offer too.""
 
The pandemic of discounting has the 3rd most common excuse, ""Indians are price sensitive, they don't buy without discounts.""
 
I have also seen discounts significantly impact returns and cancellations. When these ""founders"" rely on discounts as a core strategy due to desperation and FOMO, they are left questioning why their brand lacks trust and respect.

Simple concepts of target sell-through price, discounts only when needed to clear stocks, bundles/ deals and limited time offers to generate excitement. Sadly, everyone thinks they're a great tech firm solving complex technical issues, when in reality consumer behaviour hardly changes between physical and digital shopping. Even loyalty is far too strong a word to use. And therefore you see several physical brands moving to rewards systems - collect enough points to offset against future purchases.

Once you sell a ₹1000 product in a buy-one-get-one offer, no one will see it as worth ₹1000 again. You’ve devalued the brand. Instead of blanket discounts, brands should focus on delighting existing customers, offer sample packs, early access, or small gifts.

It is a distress sale.

Then the evaluation becomes a matter of quality/ relevance over price discount. More precisely - is this still the right price, even after discount? Or is it better to pay full price for a better/ more relevant product?

I like Sleepy Owl Coffee in this matter. Consistent pricing, and gradual reduction of discounts. Been paying almost 20% more for the last 3-4 months, but still worth the product quality at predictable pricing.","2025-10-28T06:39:07.191Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388804280880836608,7388826633513807872)","1","No","Yes"

Keeping sales boosting aside, brands often discount to liquidate aged inventory. This issue can only be mitigated, never eradicated.

The challenge is that brands don't have a separate channel to liquidate aged inventory and hence are forced to deep discount on their stores, website/app, and other marketplaces to unlock cashflow.

What we need is a destinated away from primary channels of sales, which speaks to value-focused audiences hence protecting brand equity among high-intent category consumers that a brand regularly positions to. 

About time the country builds an online factory outlet model.","2025-10-28T05:37:31.569Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7388804280880836608,7388811132951773184)","3","No","Yes"
