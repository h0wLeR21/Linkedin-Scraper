Valuation is very very important.  Promoters looking for crazy Valuation even without traction.

If you are building just another apparel business, a dry fruits business, or a basic daal-chawal trade, distribution is the key — but it is also hugely capital-hungry, especially in terms of working capital.
On the other hand, when you are solving a problem in a specific segment — whether product- or service-oriented — your offering becomes paramount. In such cases, distribution is non-core and ideally outsourced","2025-09-25T10:21:50.701Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7376510517521199104,7376923884572491776)","1","No","Yes"

Also you are the product, irrespective of if you're an owner or not. So, a lot of ways are there to groom people to think like that, meaning that such observations and decisions should not only come from the top, but can come from anyone and everyone associated with the org. ( THen ofc we can get into the politics of it all, behind ideas and decisions and perks and performances) But broader perspective would be this.
