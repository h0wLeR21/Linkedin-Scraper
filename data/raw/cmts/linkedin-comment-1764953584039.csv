The way you’ve framed 'Why Now' around inflection points makes it so clear why some businesses compound while others fade. What’s also interesting is how simple, painkiller solutions always win when a tailwind hits.

I see the same dynamic in retail trading. The tailwind is strong: rising financialisation, younger investors entering earlier, and the demand for disciplined, data-backed decision making. At MonkTrader, this is exactly the shift I’m building for, giving traders tools that simplify and strengthen the process rather than complicate it.","2025-08-22T06:16:15.540Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7363870293154549760,7364540893397241856)","0","No","No"

Spotting the tailwind before it’s obvious is less about luck and more about seeing patterns others miss. If you can combine timing, simplicity, and a capable team, growth almost feels inevitable.","2025-08-21T03:37:12.815Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7363870293154549760,7364138480441970691)","0","No","No"
