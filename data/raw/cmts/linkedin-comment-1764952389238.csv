Built an easy to access platform for SMEs, startups to get credit in the form of credit cards for spends. 

When I saw that less than 10% SMEs got access to working capital loans, something had to be done. We re-wrote the underwriting rules altogether. 

Anyway, even today, with so many Fintechs servicing this segment, we are still not able to penetrate this segment wholly. It is still WiP.","2025-11-17T05:23:47.763Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7396034345569964032,7396055434975072256)","1","No","Yes"

"Diwakar","Mitr","Diwakar Mitr","https://www.linkedin.com/in/diwakarmitr","Chemicals, AI enthusiast, Strategy, Investor, 3x Entrepreneur, Ivy League","comment","Avik Ashar Aerem looks like an excellent example of outcome based credit access. The problem with traditional approach in lending to SMEs is a lot of upfront credit checks and guarantees which screens out over 50% of demand. Lenders often don’t monitor how the funds are being used and the quality of cash flows it generates, and hence, they try to impose rigorous conditions upfront to derisk themselves.","2025-11-17T04:35:10.097Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7396034345569964032,7396043197392654336)","1","No","Yes"
