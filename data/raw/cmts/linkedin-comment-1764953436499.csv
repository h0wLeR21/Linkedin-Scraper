Uber’s saga proves what most founders forget: if your vendors and partners can’t pay rent, they don’t care about your ‘vision,’ they care about money in their hand yesterday. 

Dmart gets it; pay fast, play smart, win big. Here’s a new angle: startups obsess over burn rate and runway but ignore the dark art of crafting a cash flow ecosystem where everyone’s survival is synced. 

The real MVPs don’t just hustle for customers; they hustle to keep their entire value chain solvent and smiling. Lesson? Your cash flow game is your brand’s chrome armor; don’t let it rust.","2025-09-15T06:08:42.354Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7368880211460825089,7373236301371879424)","0","No","No"

It’s fascinating how payment timing can directly impact service availability and vendor sustainability. Businesses like Dmart set a strong example by balancing low margins with reliable payment schedules, proving that predictable cash flow builds trust and scalability. Managing inflows and outflows effectively isn’t just about survival—it’s a foundational strategy for growth and resilience.","2025-09-06T11:04:59.346Z","No","urn:li:comment:(activity:7368880211460825089,7370049372690128896)","0","No","No"

Cash flow is often underrated until it chokes growth. Your Uber example shows how it’s not just a boardroom metric; it impacts people’s daily lives. Dmart nailed it by proving that trust in timely payments is as powerful a growth lever as pricing or marketing.

For the Uber driver, that 7-day delay is the difference between making rent or not.
