  "text": "I'm scared of taking money because I heard I can get fired. \n\nThis was a question, amongst MANY that were asked this weekend at a pickleball mixer for the startup community. \n\nLet's address it head on. Yes, as investors, we design a host of protections and provisions in the definitive documents to safeguard our investment. \n\nNo, we REALLY don't want to run your company. \n\nA lot of us on the VC end have had operational careers, building across corporates/startups. \n\nWe're here to invest in the next generation of growing companies.\n\nFiring a Founder typically happens in very very extreme scenarios, namely:\n\n1. Ethics violations: Theft, embezzlement, personal enrichment at company expense, gross misconduct etc\n\nThe above doesn't leave much room for other solutions. \n\n2. Co-founder conflict: If there's unresolvable Co-Founder conflict in terms of direction of the company, then investors sometimes have to step in, along with external mediators/guides, to find a solution. This can lead to one of the dissenting Founders parting ways\n\n3. Performance (or lack of): This is a much much rarer case, with investors usually supporting by bringing in talent to support the Founders. If it can't be fixed, then this could lead to an exit\n\n4. Mega growth: Sometimes, the company grows faster than the Founders can keep up. In these cases, it's usually an amicable discussion, since the Founders are some of the largest shareholders. \n\nDecisions taken here are collaborative, to maximize the returns for all shareholders.\n\nI've covered the most common scenarios I've seen across 13 years of investing and building, chime in with anything I've missed! \n\n#vc #venturecapital #startups",

  "text": "We spend 1/3rd of our lives sleeping. 8 hours a day (ideally!). We SHOULD invest in the best mattress money can buy! This is exactly what Priyanka and Harshil (Founders of The Sleep Company) have built a stellar company around.\n\nHaving met during their IIM Calcutta days, they married, then followed different professional paths, with Priyanka climbing the corporate ladder to a ₹1cr+ package with P&G, having managed the P&Ls for brands like Ariel, Tide and Pampers across India, cementing her understanding of retail and distribution and Harshil joined his family business, exporting engineered products globally, giving him a strong grounding in manufacturing and operations.\n\nPost Priyanka giving birth, she suffered severe post partum pain, with no mattress being able to solve the sleep problem. \n\nShe brainstormed with Harshil, and together they engaged Dr Tripathi, a retired DRDO material scientist with 35+ years of experience, to build the best mattress possible. \n\nAfter nearly 2 years of R&D (and ₹1.5 crore of personal savings used), they created their patented SmartGRID technology. \n\nWhen they went to market, with a ₹29,900 mattress (average indian prices at the time were ~₹10k), even Amazon reps were uncertain this would work.\n\nRetailers blatantly rejected their attempts to place products, asking how much margin they'd get and how long the credit period was, instead of qualitative questions on the product.\n\nFrom those early hurdles, they've built a business that's close to ~₹700cr ARR today, with a VERY controlled ~₹40cr EBIDTA loss.\n\nThey've also built across new verticals. I'm a happy user of their standing desk, and am contemplating their work chair since I've seen a LOT of friends using it.\n\nMy one observation. As you grow, operational controls tend to get weaker, and this MAKES (or breaks) businesses. \n\nWhen I ordered my desk, it was damaged in transit. The team were prompt on sending me a replacement, which was the wrong size. Eventually, the right size was delivered.\n\nHowever, both the perfectly good wrong sized desk, and the scratched one, are still stuck in my apartment, with no one picking them up despite several messages.\n\nYou've built a really good business, tighten the operational controls and it's bound to be great!\n\n#venturecapital #startup #founders",

  "text": "Some events take months to plan, but the most magical ones happen within 48 hours, when the right folks and the right energy collide.\n\nThis Saturday was exactly that.\n\nI had the chance to attend a very special screening of “The Founder and The Funder” a super cool concept created by my friends Avik and Devarsh (with the Bombay Founders' Club). A fresh take on how builders and backers see each other today and how the harsh realities actually are. The kind of folks that were here at the screening and the energy, it was surreal. \n\nRight after that,  we hosted something I will remember for a long time. More than 130 founders, investors and creators came together for the “Pickle and Pitch After Party” that I co-hosted with Arjun Bhai, Avik and Devarsh. This was after Arjun Bhai had already spent almost 12+ hours doing back-to-back founder sessions at the “Pickle and Pitch - Edition 2.0”. \n\nThe energy was so vibrant. Nikunj Biyani from SuperYou, Parul Gulati (of Nish Hair), my brother Tanishq Mahendru from Courtly, Mirang Manek, Kushal Bhavsar, Priyanshi Chokshi, Aanirban Ghosh, Yash Gawde, Yash Shah and many more joined us on the pickleball court.\n\nNo judgement, No pressure and No boring pitches!! \nJust a rare space, where the ecosystem dropped the suits and picked up paddles.\n\nMassive gratitude to GoKwik, Salad Days, Red Bull and Franklin Sports with their X-40 balls for powering the vibe.\n\nWe’ve co-hosted many great mixers together over the past few months, yet what made this night special was not the size of the crowd. It was the speed of execution. Arjun Bhai called me and said “Let’s do this” and the founder in me switched on and within a day, we pulled together one of the most curated groups.\n\nPeople left with tired legs, buzzing minds and connections that will outlast most pitch decks.\n\nThis is what happens when community becomes the fuel.\nThis is what happens when founders rally together without an agenda.\nThis is what happens when sport becomes the bridge for meaningful conversations.\n\nOnwards and upwards!! \n\nElev8 India Manish Rao \n\n#pickleball #investors #founders #startups #mixer #picklenpitch #mumbai #india #sports",

  "text": "It's Rant day, therefore it's Friday.\n\nToday isn't a traditional rant. \n\nThis week, a lot of Founders asked me what goes into a successful outcome. \n\nI started with 'Assuming you're an expert in your industry, or building things'.....\n\nReasons for the above? It's f***ing hard to build something from nothing. \n\nThings that help? \n\n1.  Knowing the problem you're solving, and the industry, inside out. Usually takes a LOT of time. \n\n2. Knowing how to build things. With all due respect to folks who have built, and failed, if you've built and succeeded (sold/IPOd) those lessons are different.\n\nSo I've come up with my four points, assuming you know your industry, problem and customer needs;\n\nA. Customers: Pick up the phone and call your ex-colleagues to use you, find new ones, whatever, can you get people to pay you for your solution? \n\nB. Team: Can you attract the right folks to help you build? BIG make or break indicator. When I'm looking at companies for a funding round, if they know the gaps in their team, and know who they want to hire with that $$$, big green flag\n\nC. Grit: Can you ride the bad times? The times when there's no money in the bank and everything looks BLEAK\n\nD. Luck: Every awesome entrepreneur I've had the privilege to meet acknowledges this. You can do EVERYTHING right, sometimes it's down to luck\n\n#vc #venturecapital #startups",

When I first started writing, it was inspired by a challenge with a couple of friends Reuben Noronha and Pranjal Kalra .\n\nLearning from my brother Arjun Vaidya , it started becoming a lot more natural.\n\nOver time, I've got reactions from 'why are you spamming us' to 'can you take this post down'.\n\nThe former, I learnt to ignore. \n\nThe latter told me that there's actually a bunch of folks who care about what's being written, which adds a whole new level of fear/thought/double check on anything I'd put out. \n\nToday, at a lovely event courtesy Mohit Gulati (possibly more outspoken than I can be!) , I realized it's about sharing things that most people don't want to share in public. \n\nThe hidden thoughts, the layers of decision making that happen behind closed doors. \n\nIt's been an awesome ride,  here's to many more! \n\n#vc #venturecapital #writing",

  "text": "Anyone who knows me knows how much I talk about social capital. \n\nIt's the underlying philosophy with which we are building Bombay Founders' Club. \n\nHere's an illustration of the power of social capital in practice. \n\nOver a year and a half ago, I had the privilege of bumping into Pratik Gupta - this was when I had just started off building BFC and was looking for mentors in marketing. \n\nA call and a few WhatsApp messages later we found ourselves at The Quorum where he told me his life journey over a sif-on-the-rocks and I was mesmerised. \n\nHe happened to introduce me to one of his co-founders Arjit Johri in his amazing venture in the pickle paddle space - Serve Society | A Movement Collective. (This has now become a usual hangout and arguably the best courts in Mumbai.)\n\nArjit happened to invite me to the launch of Harajuku Tokyo Cafe in Mumbai a few months later, where I bumped into the magnanimous Avik Ashar. \n\nThis Saturday, on the 29th of November, Avik and I will be hosting founders and investors for a private screening of the first ever episode of \"The Founder & The Funder\" - a podcast where someone in the VC space (Avik) and a founder building for founders (yours truly) talk about everything startups - from co-founder conflicts, that oversmart VC analyst and being a good boss. \n\nWe are opening up a limited number of invites (lucky draw) to non-invitees and non-BFC members for this Saturday - do comment TF&TF if you'd like to put your name in the hat!\n\n#podcast #VC #founders",

  "text": "India and Greentech. So privileged to have met Sandiip Bhammer to learn about how Green Frontier Capital is out to invest in sustainable businesses across India 🥳\n\nIn his book, he shares how he met various companies that went on to become part of the portfolio, including Accacia, KisanKonnect, and what it took to make sustainable investments.\n\nSandiip is an example of patriotism beyond most. After a super successful career on Wall Street, he's spending time back in India to focus on Green Companies.\n\nEvery meeting with him leaves you thinking about how our impact on the environment can be minimal without affecting profits \n\nCo-written with Jayant Sinha (former Union Minister), with Nandan Nilekani writing the forward, this gives us a never before seen insiders perspective to how decisions are made, from a Private and Public lens.\n\nHighly recommend 🎉\n\n#venturecapital #green #renewable #vc",

  "text": "it's Rant day, therefore it's Friday. I'm picking a painful topic, called DPI.\n\nFancy term for 'how much money gent you given back as a fund' \n\nThis is CRITICAL for anybody touching the PE / VC space.\n\nSimply put, it's how much money we have given back to investors in our funds.\n\nGlobally, as well as domesticly, there's been a reassessment of Alternatives as an asset class\n\nWhy this matters? If funds don't make a great investment case, the Institutions and Family Offices around the world that have trusted us with capital, will stop doing so....\n\nThis has MAJOR repercussions for anyone associated with Funded companies.\n\nHaving raised funds for the last 7 months, I can tell you, with NO uncertainty, that folks who would give us money are thinking very deeply about the why.\n\nIndian public markets have been returning comparatively similar or better returns. \n\nThe top 10% of VC has performed very well, but the median has just about returned 1x of capital, after TEN years.\n\nFor Founders, it's important to look at the global resets and plan accordingly. The myth that USA has friendly patient high risk capital? Poof, those days are done (see link in comments).\n\nWe're firmly entering a World where building towards a real business, profits and an exit are crucial. \n\n#vc #venturecapital #founders",

It takes TIME to build a resilient business. \n\nBehind all these 1000s of crores is years and years of work, 2008 for Lenskart, 2009 for PineLabs (payments, company started in 1998).\n\nOvernight successes are very very rare, and usually accompany overnight falls\n\n2. The market is the ultimate judge\n\n3. That's how long it takes for ESOPs to really matter. Factor them into your life but don't build dreams on them\n\n#venturecapital #startups",

The old model, defined by rules like “no bachelors” or restrictions on food, no longer aligns with modern lifestyles.\n\nThis shift is fueling the rise of the co-living sector, projected to grow at ~40% CAGR through 2030, with the premium segment (₹20,000+/month) expanding the fastest as aspirations and incomes rise.\n\nWhile early players focused on rapid scale and adding supply, we believe the next leaders in this space will differentiate through service quality, real estate excellence, and an exceptional customer experience.\n\nWith this thesis, we’re excited to announce our investment in Tribe Stays’ $2.8M seed round alongside our friends at Artha Venture Partners. \n\nSatveer Jai Sumer Avik Keshav Ali Abhishek",

  "text": "It's too early for us. We don't invest at that stage. We come in at growth. Series A, B , C..... L M N O P\n\nI keep seeing Founders in my network bump up against this and get frustrated beyond belief. \n\nSharing a few (real) reasons why this comes up:\n\n1. Funds operate on Mandates. When we raise money from investors, it's with the promise that we will invest in X type of company, at Y stage.\n\nAsking us to bend that rule is asking us to BREAK OUR PROMISE to our investors. This can get us fired and sued.\n\n2. We usually write some or most of this mandate on our website, social media channels, LinkedIn bios etc. Go through those, saves a lot of time and pain\n\n3. Riverwalk Holdings (insert any fund name) is a Fund Manager. Within this, we run different Funds. Our first fund focused on Seed-Series A. Our second fund now focuses on Series B. This would be similar-ish across other funds, with tweaks in stage, sector allocation etc happening.\n\nIt's important to read the most recent news, instead of pointing out at one old article or website link that says 'Seed to Series B'.\n\n4. Different folks, different strokes. You're pre-revenue, going to a fund that doesn't do pre-revenue as a rule. This is going to lead to failure. \n\nIf you put petrol in a diesel car, do you expect it to move? Same example.\n\n5. Sectoral exposure/fit. You might not fit into the sector focus of the Fund, or they are overexposed in a sector. This is harder to suss out, but once again, biggest cues are the Fund's most recent media.\n\nWe're on the lookout too, and we post what we look for.\n\nThe above should help streamline fundraising while minimizing pain.\n\nOh and the final reason? It's just a polite no.\n\n#venturecapital #fundraising #founders",

Love em, hate em or indifferent, odds are you've heard a hundred opinions. \n\nOvervalued, bigger than the Indian eyewear market, making fools of the public, these are all terms being bandied around.\n\nBefore I unpack my thoughts, I'll go back to the original motto of Value Investing (started by Benjamin Graham, best seen in play by Warren Buffett).\n\nValue Investing is buying into an asset that you feel is intrinsically undervalued/priced.\n\nIt's notionally what we follow as VCs, except we're valuing the FUTURE POTENTIAL of the business. \n\nSimilarly, yes, loss making / nominally profitable startups have been allowed to list, which is a sign of a maturing stock market trusting the public to make their own decisions. \n\nEternal has given about 175% returns in two years, Ixigo 61% in 1.5 years, Nykaa -33% in 4 years, which tells me clearly that the 2021 madness was still in the air when Nykaa IPOd.\n\nWhat I focus on at an experiential and fundamental level is: \n\n- my parents only buy from Lenskart, loving the store experience\n\n- economies of scale on production are immense\n\n- foreign markets have been tapped well, local friends in Singapore, Japan and Dubai have made the switch and share word-of-mouth about the pricing, as well as free fix guarantee\n\n- stellar team in place \n\n- India's stock market is generally overvalued, but that's not changing because of capital controls\n\nSo, good deal at today's numbers? Probably no, but it's a stock I'm happy to hold as it grows into the number. \n\n#venturecapital #ipo #lenskart",

  "text": "JUST SAY NO! It's not Friday but here's a mini rant anyway. \n\nHumans are bad at saying two things, Yes and No. \n\nThere's a ton of research around this, I'm simplifying it into a few reasons:\n\n- We (mostly) want to be liked. Saying No hurts this.\n- Saying either Yes or No closes a door. Usually saying Yes to A, is implicitly saying No to B opportunity. Once again, we shy away from losing B\n- We hope that by saying nothing or dragging it out, the decision will resolve itself (or stop following up) and that's the end of it\n\nI've faced this across three phases of life, and I'm breaking each one down below:\n\nSales: You're looking to sell 1 of 2 things. \n\n1 - Something new. In this case, you're a category creator. Showcasing the value add to the business is critical, if you can win a pilot and show how you're improving efficiency / saving costs / (or the ABSOLUTE best) increasing revenue? \n\nYou've got a sale\n\n2 - Something better (or cheaper). Here, some version of it already exists and is in use. Replacing the incumbent requires you to showcase a HUGE difference from them, whether in cost or results. Enterprises are notoriously unwilling to shift from an incumbent because of the retraining and costs involved.\n\nStartup: I've raised over $300 million (not alone!) across 3 startups I've worked with, and the critical piece here is identifying that one champion, the person who will go to bat for you. This part is VERY VERY hard. You'll hear a hundred Nos before you get one person who'll build your round.\n\nVenture Capital Fund: By far the hardest fundraise I've done for two reasons.\n\n1 - You're competing against the World of Assets. Public equity, derivates, bonds, art, whisky casks (yes), gold, crypto, PE, then VC. All of these are avenues where wealthy folks park assets. \n\n2 - Many many champions. While a few folks will be a large part of the fund as anchor investors, funds still typically have 40-80 LPs, which means you're running a funnel speaking to 1000s of people, showcasing yourself amongst other Asset classes, then against other Funds.\n\nAcross the board, the biggest lesson I've learnt is, a quick No is one of the biggest gifts (after a Yes) you can give the World around you.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #fundraising",

  "text": "Red Bull. Some of us remember late night study sessions, some late night party sessions, for those of us in college ~2005-2015, we remember FREE cans.\n\nWhile I barely touch the stuff anymore (espresso shots if caffeine is that necessary!), I LOVE the way the brand built and marketed itself.\n\nFor those who may not know, Red Bull is originally a Thai drink called Kratik Daeng, sold at roadside stalls, mainly consumed by construction workers, drivers and folks performing hard labour.\n\nIn 1984, Dietrich Mateschitz collaborated with the drink's Founder, Chaleo Yoovidhya, adding carbonation to the beverage while preserving the charging bull logo.\n\nDietrich launched the drink in Austria in 1987, focusing on nightclubs. One of the methods Dietrich used to create virality was dropping crushed cans of Redbull outside some of the hottest clubs in the city, creating a perception that all the 'cool kids' were drinking Red Bull.\n\nBecause of it's caffeine and taurine content, for a while, the drink was banned in Hungary, France and Denmark, with no marketing allowed in Germany.\n\nThe 'banned item' craze spread through, with folks smuggling cans of Red Bull into other countries for their friends.\n\nSimultaneously, Dietrich channeled a large chunk of the brand's profits towards extreme sports marketing, sponsoring challenges and extreme sport athletes across skiing, snowboarding, skydiving, racing and more.\n\nToday, Redbull makes ~$13 billion dollars, selling in 171 countries, with a ~46% share of the energy drink market they effectively created.\n\n#startups #founderstories #marketing",

Both Abhishek and Achal echoed the same sentiment, failure isn't an option. You put your head down, show up and keep going. \n\nDhanda: Achal shared a great anecdote, when explaining what he did at Rentomojo to his to-be father in law. FIL responded, so you're a kabbadiwala? (furniture rental guy). \n\nAt the end of the day, a startup has to evolve to a business, which makes money. \n\n#venturecapital #founderstories #startups",

  "text": "The Shark Tank Effect. Making Startups Acceptable.\n\nIndia has an interesting blended culture, one that venerates success in Business, while discouraging all forms of risk taking ability for our young.\n\nFor generations, the Indian Dream has been:\n\nBecome Doctor, Lawyer or Engineer, preferably in the USA (followed by Canada and Australia). Engineer quickly became a euphemism for MBA (must do both)\n\nA successful business person in the community got respect and envious glances.\n\nSomeone trying to build a business from scratch? Usually told \"Beta, too risky, Beti focus on education and career\".\n\nSomeone quitting a high paying corporate job to start up? INSANE!\n\nIt's important to remember that the Indian startup journey is barely out of it's teenage years, with the first advents starting around 2005.\n\nA big driver to support this, not just the capital, but to make it ACCEPTABLE to start up, and similarly ACCEPTABLE to fail, is a show like Shark Tank.\n\nBy showcasing Founders from all walks of life, creating incredible businesses, from NOTHING, it's turned entrepreneurship from Taboo, to something Dadi is proud of telling her friends \"My grandchild is building a company!\"\n\n2025 is almost up, but it's the past two decades that have shaped what's to come.\n\nA robust domestic pipeline of Capital, VCs and Startups alike raising from LOCAL investors, run by folks who have been shaped by the past two decades of Indian Startups.\n\nThe WAVE of IPOs about to happen is a culmination of Hope, Energy and Awesomeness.\n\n#venturecapital #india #startups",

It probably is. \n\nA potential LP asked me how I identify or mitigate fraud. \n\nAside from the usual, diligence, deep Founder relationship and evaluation, domain knowledge, I'm sharing a few tips based on my personal history. \n\nI was part of an extremely interesting journey called Zilingo.\n\nCompany was led by good founder pedigree, assembled a strong team, raised capital from some of the best investors in the world. \n\nMy first week there, I left office on a Friday at 7pm, only to get a call to go back urgently. \n\nWe weren't going to make our projections for the month (at that time we were an e-commerce marketplace).\n\nMy first reaction is, sure, it happens, you can't whack every number out monthly.\n\nIncorrect, as per company policy. \n\nDespite us being a marketplace, I created an apple watch store, then had to go to various showrooms the next day, buy 100 apple watches and sell them at a discount. \n\nSo we could hit the numbers. So that every month was a ~10% growth. \n\nThe biggest red flag for me is very high consistent growth, at a pace that's abnormal.\n\nBusiness just doesn't work like that.\n\nIf it looks like a rabbit but quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck. \n\n#venturecapital #rant",

  "text": "Fundraising for Science Projects versus Fundraising for a Business\n\nI chatted with a Founder yesterday. They were highly technical, with a strong team around them to build in the Biotech space.\n\nThey had gone to the market for a fundraise earlier in the year, were rejected and they came to me for advice.\n\nVersion 1: Preventative care, focused directly on consumers. \n\nRejected by funds. Very clear pushback here on preventative diagnostics and the Indian consumer. Unless you can find a way to bundle it with other tests/services (selling to Diagnostic Labs and Hospitals), very hard.\n\nVersion 2: I spent twenty minutes on the call before I paused the Founder and said \"You've shared 3 different products you want to build, not told me how you're going to take them to market, how you're going to make money and, MOST IMPORTANTLY, what's your edge?\"\n\nAfter a lot of back and forth questioning, I understood what they were trying to do.\n\nThey were approaching this like a PhD research grant, with a 4 year horizon to hit the market, unclear on the proven efficacy (can their test reduce mortality or risk of disease, by what percentage, and compared to what existing test costs)\n\nMy feedback: 99% of investors will not understand this, nor will this excite the 1% who do.\n\nWhen asked for an example of a great pitch, I shared one of my personal portfolio, Lilac Insights.\n\nReferred by the Founders of Wellness Forever, Lilac's pitch, despite being in a complex field, was crystal clear.\n\n'We have licensed one of the best US tests for non invasive pre-natal (before birth) diagnostics. We've also licensed similar tests for oncology (cancer). These tests are genomic, basically testing for mutations in DNA, then our panel of experts can share suggestions on treatment path.\n\nWe will sell the tests in bulk to hospitals, so we have very low distribution costs, while assembling the best team of clinical geneticists with us, ensuring competitors will have to settle for lower talent.\n\nOver time, we will use these hospital relationships to sell additional tests, some self developed by us using funding+revenue'\n\nOur goal is to lower the costs of these tests so that more and more of the country can access them'\n\nThis pitch? Takes a complex topic and simplifies it (since most investors are NOT biotech grads).\n\nTells me exactly how they are going to distribute, control costs.\n\nChosen sectors tell me there's going to be no reluctance for spending, India will spend anything on childbirth and health, and humans generally to treat cancer.\n\nTells me their edge (best talent), let's me infer a second edge, which is the data and AI uses.\n\nTells me of the future, leveraging existing distribution to launch more tests, some proprietary.\n\nFolks, ERASE the word 'Startup' and replace it with Business, since that's what you NEED to showcase to investors.\n\nPS: Addressing the inevitable rage rants, YES, India has VERY low amounts of capital for R&D.\n\n#venturecapital #funding",

  "text": "Farming Vs Hunting    |    Retention Vs Acquisition    |   Boring Vs Fun?\n\nVery often, Founders, sales and srowth leads, young professionals, all get caught up in the excitement of NEW. \n\nGet a NEW lead. A NEW customer. A NEW channel. \n\nI sat down with all sorts of sales folks (from BigTech like Meta, Google and Stripe to other VCs raising funds) and a few points stand out:\n\nNumero Uno: It is significantly faster and easier to upsell an existing customer, than to go through the Song & Dance of convincing a new one. \n\nII : To be able to upsell, you MUST build a strong regular cadence with your customers. Ideally with one core Person In Charge / Relationship Manager (PIC/RM), along with contact points for other support (technical, legal).\n\nThe ideal from US bigtech perspective (for large clients mind you) is weekly soft touches (hey everything ok?), monthly scheduled calls (intro new feature) and quarterly business reviews. In a QBR, you compile data, showcasing their usage, highlighting any changes you feel could benefit their business (using your products of course).\n\nTrois : Existing customers are your BEST sources of new features, they will help build your product pipeline. Identify the power users, folks who LOVE your product. Asana has done a brilliant job with this, creating Asana Ambassadors within customer orgs.\n\n2² : Here's where you can use a level of 'free' or a discount without hurting your brand. Offering an existing client a 3 month trial of a new feature, or a 1 year discount on the latest product you've launched, allows you to test and upsell without hurting your pricing power for new customers.\n\nThis doesn't mean you stop looking for new customers! But it's important to prioritize, focusing on retention + upselling before chasing growth\n\n#venturecapital #saas #startups #growth",

  "text": "Negotiation. It's a skillset that we all use, on a daily basis, from our personal to our professional lives.\n\nIt's inherently driven by one of my favourite economic theories, Ricardo's Comparative Advantage.\n\nDo what you're best at, and purchase/hire skillsets you aren't the best at / don't enjoy doing.\n\nMy earliest use of negotiation was in boarding school. \n\nYou're meant to learn to make your bed, clean your cupboard and generally be tidy (at an age when a lot of folks still have parents helping with this).\n\nAn admission, I'm quite messy, and HATE tidying up.\n\nIn school, I was, thankfully, fairly bright and good at writing.\n\nWhat ensued was the perfect barter system, with me tutoring my batchmates, and helping them write essays/papers, in exchange for my bed and cupboard remaining spotless (my parents couldn't figure out how I never picked up these skills after years of boarding school!).\n\nOver time, I've enjoyed learning about negotiation from wonderful books and masterclasses, one of my favourites being Never Split the Difference, by Chris Voss.\n\nThree key lessons I've learnt:\n\n1. Define a breakpoint - This is a point where you'll either accept what's on offer, or walk away. Don't waste time and energy beyond this\n\n2. Human Problem - The world IS NOT RATIONAL. Humans are emotional beings, and often, understanding the human element in a transaction can be the make or break difference.\n\n3. Win Together - The VERY BEST deals are where both parties benefit. Reframe your negotiation to show how it benefits the other side, and suddenly, you're on the same side.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #negotiation",

  "text": "What do I need to raise a round? Who are folks who invest?\n\nPerennial questions I get asked so thought I'd take a stab at answering them, in reverse order.\n\nIf you're looking for a pre-seed round, GOOGLE IT! Reaching out to me, when it's CLEARLY mentioned in my bio that we are focused on Series B currently, shows me you're brain dead/have done zero research or both.\n\nVC funds spend time, effort and money in publicizing our thesis, writing LONG blogs on the stages and sectors we invest it, trumpeting it across media.\n\nDo give it a cursory glance if you're looking to raise.\n\nThe more pertinent place where folks need help, what do I need to raise a round? Fair question. \n\nBreaking this down (personal views mind you):\n\nFundraising is a balance between Revenue and Story (read History).\n\nIf you have zero revenue? Bring a great story. \n\nWhy am I building this? Because I was at XYZ big companies, noticed the ABC process was broken, have validated this with colleagues and managers across the industry, have my first 3 paid pilots in progress.\n\nBOOOM. You're probably raising a round. (and YES, odds are to get to those positions, there's a strong academic background).\n\nNo Story? Bring numbers that can't be ignored.\n\nSome rough guidelines - \n\nPre-seed: This is a fairly new concept, All in Capital, ZeroPearl, A Junior VC, Eximius, Mars Shot, great folks to talk to.\n\nNo real rules here, can be zero revenue as well, though some helps. Anything up to ₹30-40 lakhs a month.\n\nSeed: This has ranges. Yes, there are bigger $3-5 million (₹24-40 crore) rounds. Odds are, you don't qualify. This requires a second time founder (exit of AT LEAST ₹25 crore, not I built and failed, now building again), or STRONG corporate experience, along with good numbers (₹50 lakh to ~1.5 crore / month)\n\nSeries A: Rounds of $3-10 million, requires you to showcase basic product-market fit, revenue numbers between ₹1 to ₹3 crore\n\nSeries B: Rounds of $5-20 million. By now, funds are evaluating your ability to scale. Your core customers should be identified, with strong retention trends. The core evaluation here is, can this investment propel you to an inflection point of growth, creating a new product line or expanding into new markets.\n\nSeries C and onwards: Rounds mushroom from here, tweaked to give you 24+ months of runway, with a buffer. Rounds are largely dictated by two things.\nYour business plan + FOMO in the market.\n\nNote: All of the above doesn't apply to deeptech / biotech.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #fundraising",

  "text": "Friday Rant Time! We are our own worst enemies.\n\nThere's been a lot of conversation after the Wintrack Founder's allegations around harassment, and I did a straw poll amongst friends who are business owners (legacy, traditional, startups, scale-ups, all of em).\n\nThe resounding, and sadly predictable answer? Yes, this is the norm.\n\nIt's the dirty laundry we don't discuss. The garbage swept under the rug, till the rug is the size of a mountain.\n\nAs a nation, we need to come together and reject 'fast-track'. Push back when pushed. \n\nThe funniest (and one of the saddest) story I heard, was about how there's a 'one window system' for a certain approval now. \n\nWhich is great, ideally solves the problem! However, the approval never comes. Or gets blatantly rejected despite everything being in order.\n\nTill the friend had to call the 'approver on the system', hear the 'request' and comply, so that the approval went ahead.\n\nWe have AI tools that can change the world.\n\nIt's time we implement them into our nation's systems, to reduce human 'subjectivity', and clean things up.\n\nEverything is poised for the next decade (or more) to be India's time to shine. We need to remove the final barriers, and the growth will be unstoppable.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #india",

  "text": "IPO - A key goalpost, a transformational moment, where you've grown up. \n\nA startup no longer, you're a mature(ish) public company, with the regulatory and regular scrutiny that comes with it.\n\nA lot's been said about India's Venture Ecosystem, and a large sign of maturity is companies achieving, and then thriving, post an IPO.\n\nBetween 2021-2024, Indian startups created around $7 billion (₹64,000 crores) in Market Cap, creating ~$3.5 billion of liquidity going back to Founders, Employees, Funds, and through Funds, the LPs (investors in Funds).\n\nAcross 2025-2026, we've got a projected $50 billion (₹450,000 crores) of Market Cap, projected to return around $25 billion (~₹225,000 crores) of liquidity all stakeholders involved.\n\nThis is a transformational moment, since it firmly cements Venture Capital as a maturing asset class, with Family Offices and Institutions from India and the World looking at India with a deep focus for the next decade.\n\nWhy is this a relevant metric? I was having a chat with a Founder today who was firmly convinced VC is sipping cocktails, laid back days and a pretty easy breezy life.\n\nI shared a thought. A startup needs one, maybe two funds to believe in them, and back them with capital.\n\nThe average fund? Has around 40 LPs. Which means you've (somehow) convinced 40 folks to back you.\n\nVC funds? It's our job to invest in startups, that's the ONLY thing the capital is there for.\n\nFamilies/HNIs? Public equities, Private Equity, Private Credit, Debt, Bonds, Art, Crypto, even Whisky and Wine are investible assets. \n\nVC competes for attention against all of them.\n\n#venturecapital #india #startups #ipo",

  "text": "It's that time of the year again, Global Fintech Festival. \n\nThe size and scale of the event are reflective of the transformation that's taken place in India across the past 15 years.\n\nFrom a familiar sight of 'Cash Only' at many venues (restaurants, small stores, most low-medium ticket purchases), we have a thriving payments ecosystem underpinned by world class infrastructure, through the Unified Payments Interface.\n\nAs of September 2025 (last month), UPI handled an average of 654 MILLION transactions ...... DAILY. \n\nFrance, Singapore, Bhutan, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and the UAE have already enabled UPI links, allowing seamless connections with their domestic payment solutions.\n\nIn Razorpay, we have a homegrown payments system that's comparable with global giants, innovating at a startling pace, able to work under low bandwidth conditions (notable mention to Pine Labs as well, for widespread payment solutions).\n\nZerodha and Groww have created widespread financial inclusion at low/no-cost, allowing folks across India to participate in our stock market, leading to improved savings and financial security.\n\nNavi, Lendingkart, Slice, Jupiter and several more have improved access to credit (though this can be a double-edged sword).\n\nClose to home, Riverwalk's portfolio companies Homeville Group helps make home loans more accessible and affordable, while Aerem has created an entire platform to support SMEs to adopt solar solutions, with access to financing, EPCs and equipment, acting as a 'Solar Saathi'.\n\nThe sheer energy is incredible, with folks from all over the world visiting to learn how they can participate in India's growth story\n\n#gff #venturecapital #startups",

  "text": "Highlights from recent LP chats:\n\nIt's a Marathon, Not a Sprint: India has had a HOT stock market run, till the beginning of this year.\n\nFolks who had barely/never invested before, including large family offices (surprising right?) suddenly woke up and dived headfirst into public equities, assuming there was only one way to go. UP.\n\nFor a lot of people, this year has been a shocker. Markets can lie flat? Sectors can go down? \n\nEspecially given the stellar performances from Korea, Germany, Japan and China's indexes.\n\nOnce Bitten, Twice Shy: Venture Capital returns for Investors in Funds aren't equal. \n\nBased on Prequin Data, the top 10% of VC firms returned over 35% IRR (~3.2x MOIC) across 2015 to 2025.\n\nThe next 10% returned around 24% (~2.4x MOIC).\n\nAfter that, it steadily declines down to ~1x MOIC, which means, 0 returns, but capital was given back.\n\n(anyone confused about time period vs MOIC, should remember VC funds return capital from ~year 5 onwards, and drawdown across a 3-4 year period).\n\nYes, returns are HEAVILY skewed towards the top. Which is where selection of Fund Managers becomes critical. \n\nHow are they getting into the best companies, what's their right to EXIST, forget WIN. \n\nI Wanna Do Direct!: The flavour of the month amongst some of the younger family offices I've had chats with is they have jumped into pre-IPO, late stage investments.\n\nThe reality of the situation? Unless you're buying out the Seed stage investors, if a growth investor is selling you part of their shareholding? They have access to WAY more information than you do about the company.\n\nI've met some amazing offices that have set up strong internal teams, using Fund investments to identify great companies, then double down with Direct investments, often leveraging Fund pro-rata rights\n\nOverall, VC/PE investments should be looked at as part of an overall asset allocation, with a balance between risk & return.\n\n#venturecapital #familyoffice #investing #startups",

  "text": "It's rant time, therefore it's Friday! A really important topic, Deposits/Advances ARE NOT Revenue!\n\nThis is a critical mistake a lot of companies make while scaling and it's a very optimistic Founder error. \n\nShowcasing via a few examples. \n\nYou're a SaaS company that's got a client who's signed up for an annual plan, BUT you have a cancellation + refund option, let's say 1 month's fee as charges. \n\nA client pays you for a year. \n\nHow do you record revenue in your MIS, AND how do you manage the money? \n\nIt's really really tempting to recognise the full amount (that way mean VCs looking for ARR see a big number) as well as treat the entire amount as earned, therefore spendable.\n\nI get it. But if you're looking to build with a real customer focus (also Ethics), it's best to keep that cash in a separate account. \n\nRecognise revenue on a straight line monthly basis. \n\nThat way, if a customer cancels, you can refund immediately instead of being caught with pants down.\n\nSimilarly, you're a housing/furniture/electronics company. Client pays you a deposit. \n\nOver time, that's a meaty amount of capital sitting in your account. \n\nDO NOT use it. Ok, use ~8% of it (one month forward), to be on the prudent side. \n\nI've seen complaints recently against a host of companies unable to pay back a few thousand rupees of customer deposit. \n\nThis will MURDER your credibility. Not to mention, if you eventually wind up (which happens in startup world), you're honouring your customer trust by returning their deposits.\n\n#venturecapital #rant #finance #startups",

No longer exists \n\nWith the advent of digital payments, an under the radar casualty has been sweets sales\n\n#venturecapital #growth #startups #founderstories",

  "text": "A Founder conversation yesterday (subject for tomorrow's post) left me with an interesting thought. How do you know you're aligned with what you do?\n\nA good method is to test if the North Star is the same. What's the one thing you want, professionally, and does it match your company?\n\nRiverwalk Holdings and I felt that sync quickly. Chatting with Jai Sumer Singh, CFA, he mentioned that we want a Riverwalk investment to be a signal.\n\nThat Founders are strong, business is solid and chances of success are high. \n\nA stamp, an indicator, something deeply meaningful.\n\nAnd it resonates very closely with my professional goal, the ability to give GREAT recommendations. \n\nWhether it's a strategic call or an investment decision, that's been something I've wanted to build towards.\n\nThe harsh sides of this mean you say no a lot.\n\nYou're very very careful before making an introduction, a suggestion.\n\nIt also means you need to be absorbing information, constantly, about what's changing.\n\nInvesting (public markets, PE, VC) is all a game of making the best possible decisions with available information. \n\nIn this space, I like the full form of the often misquoted \"A Jack of All Trades, A Master of None, but Oftentimes better than a Master of One\"\n\n(Not sure how many folks knew the full quote!)\n\n#venturecapital #investing #startups #funding",

  "text": "Eat your frog first. 🐸\n\nOne of my favorite to-do list philosophies is that you should tackle your hardest, most undesirable task at the start of each day. Maybe it's hard, maybe it makes you uncomfortable, or maybe it's just something you've been putting off for weeks. That's your frog.\n\nThe idea comes from a quote attributed to Mark Twain: “If it's your job to eat a frog, it's best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it's your job to eat two frogs, it's best to eat the biggest one first.\"\n\n​So if you want to be more productive, find that task and do it first. Not only do you get it out of the way, but you feel energized for the rest of the day. Even if you accomplish nothing else, you tackled the hardest thing when you had the most mental energy.\n\n​Some people prefer building momentum with easy wins first—and that’s another great tactic—but for me, the frog method is so much more effective.\n\n​I have a column in my Coda to-do list called “frog” with a little frog emoji next to the task. Just identifying it makes a difference; that's the one I put off yesterday, the one that requires extra activation energy today.\n\nThe quote finishes with, “and nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of the day.” As gross as this analogy is, it is a great mindset hack.\n\n​Here’s my Coda doc with all my thoughts on productivity philosophies, which includes a to-do list template for tackling your frog first: https://lnkd.in/gfD9xAu7",

  "text": "This is a post on H1-B visas since it's the flavour of the moment! \n\nKidding, it's not directly about it.\n\nThere's a certain magic that happens when Indians, trained in India, across all education, premier institutes to smaller colleges, go abroad. \n\nBecause our brilliance, our work ethic, our energy, is supported by an environment that allows these to thrive and grow, into new businesses or leadership positions.\n\nI'll use a drive, from my parents place to mine yesterday, as an example. (I usually avoid driving, as that time can be used better, and it triggers road rage for me).\n\nObservations:\n\n- Two cops, on a bike, without a care in the world, helmetless, going the wrong way down a one way. Stopped to get chai as well, so clearly not an emergency\n\nWhen our law enforcement laughs at the law, sends a powerful message\n\n- A biker, slipped and fallen in the middle of the road (helmetless, obviously). Stopped to help, so many folks did as well, helped carry him to the roadside, moved his bike\n\nOur spirit mobilizes beautifully to help in certain situations\n\n- A wonderful fellow who went the wrong way, down a one way again, and yelled at me to get out of his way\n\nZero civic sense, we operate on a \"Is this good for me\" mentality, instead of \"Is this good for us\" as a community or country.\n\nEnough has been said about broken roads, it's an absolute and completely visible showcase of broken systems and corruption (since relaying the roads is a source of recurring revenue, after the first windfall from cutting corners).\n\nChats with Founders over the weekend add to it:\n\n- 'I was promised a startup grant but it's not being released' (have seen this in a personal investment as well, the company nearly died and had to raise at PAINFUL terms to survive, despite having qualified for a large grant which took it's own sweet time to be released)\n\n- 'My GST number application has taken over four months and I've been told there's only one way to expedite it'\n\nLet's not forget, taxation feels like it tells you two things:\n\nDon't be successful\nOR\nUse the wonderful loopholes that exist and thrive\n\nAs an Indian, and an investor, I'm VERY VERY excited about a wave of new, fantastic talent, coming back with energy to build.\n\nAs a pragmatist and patriot, I desperately hope we prepare the soil for this growth, through further ease of business, taxation, cutting out red tape.\n\nGreat trees can't grow in a desert.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #india",

  "text": "Friday rant time! Please, please, please, don't max out your credit cards, take on debt or investment that's unsustainable for your family, all in the hopes that if you get an MVP running, you'll magically land VC funding.\n\nDo it if you're looking to build a good profitable business for yourself.\n\nI've spoken to a bunch of folks this week, ranging from delusional:\n\nGive me $4.5 million in seed for my climatetech company at MVP stage, oh btw I have no background in climatetech, nor do I have some incredible track record\n\nTo earnest but lacking an understanding of themes, sectors and process:\n\nI'm building Urban Company, but for Tier 3! It will be a billion dollar+ outcome, fund me.\n\nFirst off, you need 1 of 2 things to get funding. Great numbers OR Great track record. \n\nWhy, you ask? Why isn't startup investment somehow available to everyone, like air to breathe? \n\nIt takes a MASSIVE amount of effort to raise a fund. Let's say a fund has enough capital for 20 investments. That's 20 bullets, to be fired, hoping to hit a target really really really far away, namely big returns.\n\nEvery investor is looking to maximize those odds of success, by any tiny signal or tool they can find.\n\nFor me? It's Numbers Or Story. Notice, I haven't worked at McKinsey or Google. Haven't studied at IIT or IIM. So I completely respect folks not from that track.\n\nHOWEVER, I followed the work path. Joined a great tech company out of college (through my extracurriculars in college). Got VERY lucky, admittedly, to join, then run a family office at a young age.\n\nTook a risk joining a Series A startup, moving to Bangkok then Singapore (low pay in the early days). Helped raise over $300 Mn for the company. \n\nBuilt my own company, had to wind it up, fought to deliver any exit possible.\n\nSimilarly, folks who've fought for SUPER competitive seats, especially if they've had to earn scholarships to afford it, gotten into great colleges, then great careers, have created a story that shows their efforts.\n\nI know I sound like a broken record occasionally when I keep highlighting this, but it must be said.\n\nVC funding ISN'T the ideal for most companies that need to be built. NOR do we need delivery app number 200.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #funding #rant",

  "text": "Yes, Money Matters. \n\nJust got off a fantastic call with the CIO of a large family office. As usual, it was enlightening. \n\nWhat countless folks DON'T get is that there's no Venture Capital Fund, without raising said Fund. \n\nAnd raising? Is HARD.\n\nA great startup? Raises seed from 1-2 institutions.\n\nA great fund? Will still have at least 15-20 LPs (Limited Partners, fancy name for investors), though more typically ~40-50.\n\nKey highlights from today's call?\n\n- Global uncertainty hurts, hence FOs are wary of long term capital blockage\n- Derivates and commodities are returning ~14- 18% IRR with weekly liquidity (yes this is real at high finance levels)\n- INR depreciation is 3-4%, annualized, needs to be factored in. Wealth is NOT tied to India, looks for opportunities where returns are best, factoring in taxes, fees and depreciation\n- Having a long track record and massive skin in the game as GPs is SOLID\n\nA really interesting point of discussion I've had with a few CIOs with a long term outlook is that we need to create more IP and products, as opposed to cost arbitrage businesses. \n\nBoth have their place, but technology-driven companies make up under 7% of the Indian stock market, as opposed to 15-20% globally, which means there's HUGE tailwinds to grow.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #fundraising",

  "text": "Bose. A household name. And one of the earliest examples of true product obsession, Indian intelligence and American exceptionalism.\n\nAmar Bose was born in Philadelphia, to an Indian Freedom Fighter and an American schoolteacher. \n\nGrowing up, he earned spending money by fixing old radios and other electronics, sparking a love for engineering.\n\nHe followed up on this passion, graduating from MIT (bachelors, masters and a doctorate) in electrical engineering.\n\nNow with a successful career, he purchased a high-end stereo system but hated the sound quality, finding it 'flat'. \n\nHe spent the next decade tinkering around, till he released his first product, the 2201 speaker.\n\nIt ignored MANY conventional rules in sound design, leading to critics slamming the product.\n\nBUT .... People LOVED it. The sound quality was revolutionary, making customers feel like there was a concert going on in their house.\n\nNot content with this innovation, Bose went on to pioneer the first active noise cancellation, enjoyed by many of us on the move today.\n\nThe company went on to build RideActive suspension systems for trucks, leading to lower cabin noise and disturbance, along with deep research into the field of acoustics.\n\nBose famously said \"I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by MBAs. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn't been done before\".\n\nProduct obsession and customer-centricity, along with a DEEP passion for Sound, led to the Bose we know and love today\n\n#startups #founders #tech",

  "text": "I don't usually post on Sundays but this week, was unwell for a good part of it (glad to recover in time for Ashish Wadhwani hosting us at his institution, IvyCap Ventures day!)\n\nA really important point that came up this weekend, with some family offices who were getting to know us at Riverwalk Holdings.\n\nA big piece was focusing on how we 'add value' in today's day and age, with every fund claiming we do something amazing for portfolio companies.\n\nWell first off, we DON'T interfere in your day-to-day operations. Our belief is simple, if you've backed the right Founder, they are the experts on daily operations.\n\nWhen it comes to 6-monthly  / yearly MIS. We're not here to police you. As a team built with folks who have built businesses, from a family or startup angle, the one thing we know for sure?\n\nYour best laid plans can (and probably will) go awry. \n\nOur need to see numbers? To understand the Founder's thought process. \n\nFolks who are overtly optimistic, and have failed to hit any numbers projected? Will go through a hard time.\n\nBUT! We are the folks who are here to listen, about what happened. \n\nOnce investors have invested, we SHOULD be your best friends (with tough love). Since we're now in for the long haul. \n\nAnyone raising today? Ref check your investors, figure out how they are in Good Times, as well as Bad\n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders",

Humans are WAY too optimistic.\n\nThe reality? Over 90% of ventures born, fail. I say ventures because ANYONE, starting ANYTHING, is a venture. Ignore the sexy word, startup.\n\nThere are NO safety nets. If you pour your own money in and it fails, that money is gone.\n\nYou WILL NOT be compensated at your previous level in the Early Stages.\n\nIf you bootstrap, you eat what you kill. It's your choice how to use profits to reinvest in the business or take home.\n\nIf you take funding, despite what many armchair warriors comment on, NO investor is letting you draw your previous BigCorp compensation. This is truth.\n\nSo before taking the plunge, factor in your liabilities. Your responsibilities. \n\nSomeone who's solely supporting a few people in their family? Bad idea.\n\nEither make the leap young, after 2-4 years of work ex, when responsibilities are low and bouncing back into the workforce is easy.\n\nOr do it mid-career, once you've built up savings to cushion you, ideally with an earning spouse so there's income coming into the household. \n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders",

  "text": "Not all solutions are created equal. \n\nA good solution's most important feature? It solves a deep, critical problem, in a hard to replace/replicate way. \n\nI've seen this happen often. \n\nFolks have a passion for entrepreneurship (also called masochism).\n\nThey WANT to become a Founder, so start looking for problems to solve.\n\nNot a bad way to go about it, though my personal favourite is when Founders are solving problems they've faced during their careers.\n\nNow in order to make money, the problem you stumble upon should ideally: \n\n1. Be meaningful: For any company, this means it costs a lot. Everything can be broken down to cost, so time/manhours equals cost. \n\n2. No clear solution: Folks have tried to apply patchwork fixes but there's no clearcut solution\n\n3. Single point of pain: Ideally, the problem should be departmental/attributable. Someone must be in charge of it \n\n4. Recurrence: The fix should require your solution constantly\n\nIf you've ticked all four boxes above? You've got a solid business. \n\nIt's important to remember that corporate sales cycles have a host of problems. \n\nYou NEED a champion, at a high enough position, with runway in the company, to push your product through the door and into regular use. \n\nI'm sure every B2B sales person reading this has had a really close conversion, where their SPOC left the company/was transferred etc and the deal went ALL THE WAY back to the beginning. \n\n#venturecapital #startups #b2b #sales",

  "text": "Taking a cue from Rishabh Mariwala's morning post, Founder Market fit is one of the key things I am looking out for.\n\nWhile I deeply respect folks who've gone out to build, if you've never done it before and are trying in an unfamiliar industry, you're setting yourself up for failure.\n\nSharing two adages that I follow closely, the first being:\n\nGreat Founder x Terrible Market - Market Wins. Smart Founders pivot, which basically means finding a new market\n\nGreat Founder x Average Market - Decentish outcome\n\nGreat Founder x Great Market - Magic happens 🥳 \n\nThe second being:\n\nThe first time you build, build in a space you know VERY well. Because EVERYTHING else is against you. We ARE a hard country to do business in.\n\nNew clients are skeptical, there's a massive trust deficit.\n\nPayment cycles? Welcome to Hell.\n\nThe best way to mitigate these odds? Build in familiar territory. You know the first few potential customers, along with the best hires. \n\nYou understand the cycles of the industry, along with gaps to be filled.\n\nBuild and Sell two companies (~₹20cr+ bootstrap, ₹100cr+ VC backed), then go nuts, build in anything you want.\n\nYou understand the hardest parts of 0 - 1, you have a reputation that can attract customers, talent and capital. Go nuts, solve crazy problems.\n\n#venturecapital #india #startups #founders",

Well, WTFund showed me yesterday! \n\nThe team invited me to join as an external expert for a couple of evaluation calls, and I was blown away by some of the problems folks are solving.\n\nConsidering my inbox is usually filled with:\n- Hyperlocal X delivery\n- Consumer Brand 1000\n- Super App 15000\n- Give me money THEN I will build some sexy technology team\n\nIt was AMAZING to see chat with two fantastic companies (not naming!) solving real problems.\n\nFirst one is building machines to allow engineers to quickly fabricate PCBs, allowing new iterations to happen in days, instead of weeks (which is reality in China today, but not India).\n\nFounder felt the problem when they were building their own hardware, and decided to solve it.\n\nSecond, looking to fix robotics adoption for Indian SMEs, with a hyper focus on adaptability, incremental automation, cost and ROI.\n\nBoth teams come are young, having worked in their respective industries enough to understand what Great looks like, white spaces to build, and have made enough mistakes during their corporate stints (so they won't repeat those!).\n\nThey are solving in innovative sectors, with a technology forward approach, with potential for global scale, while creating a huge impact on the Indian manufacturing space.\n\nAt Riverwalk Holdings, we are very bullish on manufacturing and innovating for legacy businesses, with prime examples being our investments in Mirana Toys and Venwiz.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #innovation #india",

  "text": "So… what actually happens after you get selected to build3’s Impact Accelerator?\n\nThis is a question we get asked often.\n\nSo let me break it down, the program progress flow here(the sessions/practices flow is for another post 🙃 ) - \n\n- Around 50–100 startups/founders are selected, from the thousands that apply, to form the final cohort.\n\n- Around 80–90% of them go through an internal pitching round called the Zebra Tank. \nA no-nonsense pitch room where founders test conviction, refine their story, and spar with operators and mentors.\n\n- From there, 40–50% make it to the Bar Raiser, where a panel of investors sits in, and we evaluate who gets backed.\n\n- Eventually, the top 3–5 startups receive their first cheque - ₹25 lakhs from our side, plus full-stack support across product, growth, and founder alignment.\n\n- And then comes Demo Day - where select startups from multiple cohorts pitch to a curated network of 100–200 investors.\nWe’ve seen 2–3 CR of follow-on capital flow in from there.\n\nWe’ve had founders from all over India, but Delhi, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Pune still dominate the map.\nAnd the top sectors among these are - health & wellness, education, fintech, and travel.\n\nEach cohort is different, each startup is unique. But something remains common.\nFounders building their hearts out. Solving for Impact, solving for mind, body, and planet.\n\nWe don’t promise overnight wins.\nBut if you're building with purpose, we're here for the long game.\n\nNext Cohort applications are open.\nExcited to see what you’re working on.",

  "text": "Cash flow is the King, Queen and Ace.\n\nWhether a business, freelancer or working professional, managing your inflows and outflows of cash is one of the singular most important skills to survive (or fail).\n\nThe biggest example seen recently. I switched my Uber payments to credit card from UPI (points!!!!) and saw a noticeable lag in getting rides. \n\nLast night, an Uber driver asked me how I'm paying. I mentioned it was via card and he asked, very politely, if I could switch it to UPI.\n\nHe mentioned that it takes 7+ days for the card settlements to hit his account from Uber, which is unsustainable for him. \n\nDmart is a classic business example of folks who understood the power of cash flow. \n\nThey offer some of the lowest margins in India to suppliers, however payments are settled religiously within 30 days, no delays. \n\nThis leads to predictable cash flow for business owners, along with volumes.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders",

  "text": "Family Offices. A new-age term for India, but a mechanism by which European and American families have been protecting and growing wealth consistently for decades.\n\nA big thanks to BCAS - Bombay Chartered Accountants' Society and Kinnari Gandhi for inviting me to be a part of their Family Office summit on Saturday.\n\nStarting off with a fantastic keynote from Rishabh Mariwala, who's family office Sharrp Ventures has played a pivotal role in the Indian startup space, there were fantastic sessions across topics.\n\nI had the pleasure of moderating one with Sachin Tagra, Anupa Tanna Shah, Samir Shah and Rubin Chheda, on the evolution of Family Offices and the advent of new asset classes available, from Public Equities to Private Credit, Venture Capital/Private Equity to Derivatives.\n\nAnupa shared her family's evolution, from creating wealth in Commodities, to preserving and growing it through Real Estate.\n\nRubin, who runs Neo's  Private Credit fund, showcased the important role Family Office capital holds in supporting the next generation of entrepreneurs through access to debt capital, and how lucrative the space can be.\n\nSachin manages JSW Ventures, which, similar to Riverwalk, began as a Single Family Office, evolving into a full fledged institutional fund, anchored by the original family, raising a majority of capital from external investors (usually other Family Offices).\n\nRahul Khanna, CIO of Metro Shoes, explained how it's important to look at post-tax, post-fees returns, while Subeer Monga and Devashish Khanna explained what it takes for FOs to evaluate direct investments.\n\nSubeer, sharing a VC perspective, suggested that FOs should co-invest alongside Funds they've invested in, ideally in sectors they have deep experience in.\n\nDevashish, who runs a Single Family Office, explained that building teams to do direct investments takes significant effort and expense, so it's important for FOs to understand whether they are ready to commit to the cost + time.\n\nOne of the resounding commonalities was focusing on good advisors, folks who take a long term approach, instead of making a quick buck by selling every 'sexy' opportunity (pre-IPO rounds anyone?)\n\n#venturecapital #familyoffice #wealth",

  "text": "Friday Rant time! Please DON'T fall for scamsters & hamsters. \n\nA Founder pinged me last night, saying there's a UK based family office who's keen to invest in their startup, but needed £30K sent to them before a term sheet can be issued.\n\nFor all Founders out there, this is BULL***T! No real investor is asking you to PAY for a term sheet to be issued.\n\nFor those who aren't fully familiar, Term sheets are non-binding agreements. They cover all the broad terms that between the Investor, Founders and the Company, broadly around investment terms, control, equity, governance etc.\n\nFolks, there are broadly a few sets of Investors:\n\nAngels - Folks who have enough money to give you ~₹20 lakhs to ₹1 crore.\nThese are typically smaller family business owners, business execs or folks who've sold their companies\n\nVenture Capital Firms - We're all typically SEBI registered (if India based), or registered with the equivalent in whichever country we're domiciled. The partners will have a strong track record, and the fund will typically have one as well. Easy to research.\n\nFamily Offices - Definitely an upcoming source of funds, there are broadly three kinds. Very actively managed FOs with large teams (examples include Sharrp Ventures, Capri Global etc). Slightly more understated, representing large family businesses (B2V, Ananta Capital). Very very quiet (not naming for obvious reasons), representing families who have exited their businesses/monetizing land holdings, and are now capital allocators (~₹5,000Cr+)\n\nCommon theme amongst EVERYONE above? We DO NOT CHARGE you for investing. (there will be due diligence costs, but that's to cover external legal and accounting firms, on actuals).\n\nThere are some angel networks that do charge, up to 2% to cover expenses is okayish, if you're struggling on a raise they are an option. Once again, DO NOT PAY until successfully raising.\n\nAt later stages, investment bankers lend a lot of value, and charge 1-3% for that service, again, ON SUCCESS. This is quite fair.\n\nIt's sad but the reality of the world is, there's always more demand for capital than access to it.\n\nIn the midst of that desperation, don't let scammers take advantage of you.\n\n#venturecapital #rant #founders",

While it's important not to let incorrect decisions weigh you down, it's equally important to reflect on what led you to make the decision at the time.\n\nDecisions are typically = Information you have X Current thought process\n\nI usually like evaluating if:\n- The decision I made given the information was on point\n- Did I have enough accurate information\n- Was there anything I could have done better in the evaluation\n\nApple is one of the few companies on the public side where I was very very wrong. I was an Apple Bear. Anti the company. \n\nAfter two years of using a Macbook (still hate the phones :P), I can say I was very wrong.\n\nAnd a large part of this is due to Apple's decision making tree. Typically, for companies, every major product line has their own teams.\n\nIn Apple, there's a Battery team, that looks at ALL products.\n\nSimilarly, team for Screens, Chips etc.\n\nI recently had a long conversation with a friend in the Battery team and it's amazing how they make decisions. \n\nOnce they're 80% convinced it's the right call, they get samples for testing, run compatibility checks across product lines, then pull the trigger on ordering.\n\nIf they made a mistake, they reevaluate using the framework above.\n\n#venturecapital #technology #decisions",

  "text": "Dream11's exit from their ₹358 crore BCCI sponsorship deal - with BCCI waiving penalties due to government regulations - reminded me of a costly lesson I learned during the early IPL mobile rights days.\nBack then, we had acquired IPL Mobile Digital rights and partnered with Nokia as our exclusive mobile partner. Everything was going well until legislation banned VAS services overnight. When we rushed to review contracts, I discovered a painful reality - Nokia had ironclad protection clauses for regulatory changes, but I had no such mirror provisions with my licensor.\nNokia walked away clean. I was left holding the bag.\nThe asymmetry in contract terms taught me that in regulated industries, you're only as protected as your weakest contractual link.\nKey takeaways for founders:\n🔹 Mirror Your Risk Clauses - If you're giving downstream partners regulatory exit clauses, ensure you have identical protection upstream\n🔹 Legislative Force Majeure - In sectors like gaming, telecom, or fintech, standard force majeure isn't enough. You need specific regulatory change provisions\n🔹 Don't Bank on Goodwill - Dream11 got lucky with BCCI's understanding. Most contracts won't be this forgiving\n🔹 Risk Cascade Analysis - Map how regulatory risks flow through your entire contract chain. One weak link can sink the ship\n\nThe Dream11-BCCI situation shows institutional maturity in handling unforeseen regulatory challenges. But as founders, we can't rely on such understanding.\nBuild your contracts assuming the worst-case scenario - because sometimes it happens.\n\n#Startups #Contracts #RiskManagement #IPL #Entrepreneurship #LessonsLearned Kalaari Capital Dream11",

  "text": "Friday rant time. Investors don't take risks. Everyone wants Tier-1 background. \nNobody is out there for the little guy.\n\nSharing a brief breakdown of VC economics (deep dive link in comments).\n\nVC is NOT charity, it's pure financial services. The NUMBER ONE metric we're measured by (for older funds) is DPI, fancy term for how much money you've given back.\n\n1x, shut shop and go home. 2x, better, but still bad. 3x, now you have a reason to live. (for folks wondering how young funds are measured, it's typically MOIC + IRR, basically, how are companies you've invested in performing at present).\n\nAssume a ₹200 crore seed stage fund. Needs to give back ₹600 crore at least.\nIgnoring fees and expenses, you can invest ₹10 crore in 20 companies, for 10% each.\n\nSince it's quite clear (Fractal, Zomato, BlueStone, Nykaa) that it takes 12-14 years to IPO a startup in India, you can't wait that long (fund life is 10 years).\n\nSo you have to exit to Series C/D investors who WILL want a discount.\n\nAssume 3 rounds of dilution, leaves you with ~5%, 20% discount, so 4% held.\n\nSeed has ~75% mortality rate, so 5 companies left.\n\nThese 5 have to get you ₹600 crore.\n\nAt 4% held:\n\n1 company needs to raise at ₹15000 - Just NOT happening\n2 companies raise at ₹7500 - Still VERY unlikely\n3 companies raise at ₹5000 - Closer\n4 companies raise at ₹3750 - Possible\n5 companies raise at ₹3000 - More possible\n^This is also the price Minimalist was acquired by HUL, which was an OUTLIER outcome and first of it's kind for consumer startups.\n\nThe above should illustrate how hard the business is.\n\nHence when funds insist on backing folks with successful exits, strong corporate careers, or absent both, just a great educational background, is maximizing luck.\n\nAt Seed, there are two things that swing it for you. I call it Numbers & Story.\n\nIf you have a GREAT story (I sold my last company for ₹500 crores), you can have ~no numbers.\n\nIf you have a good story (I was VP Google India), once again, numbers are lower priority.\n\nIf you're 22, from a small town college, breaking it down harshly, you NEED numbers.\n\nAs an investor, we just DON'T ignore amazing growth. That being said, since this is a (very hard) financial business, we're looking at any and every indicator of possible success.\n\nExperience here helps in two ways:\n- Have already made dumb mistakes on OTHER peoples money\n- Have a network who will pick up the phone and help you/become first customer\n\n#venturecapital #startups #funding",

  "text": "Can we get an hour for your insights? Would love to bounce ideas off.\nPlease take a look at our pitch deck.\n\nIf these are genuine requests, sure, let's chat. For investments, we're focused on growth investments currently, so early stage, not going to progress.\n\nAlso, I detest roundabout tactics. When I'm selling (and sales never stops, as a VC you're fundraising/selling the fund), it's a very direct 'Hi, we're raising, I'd love to chat'.\n\nQuick tips:\n\nI put down everything I know about fundraising, VCs, leadership, hell my life journey down in my substack (link in comments). Read through first, then hit me up with specific questions, significantly better use of time for both of us.\n\nApproach with a very specific ask if possible, it makes it easier than 'gain insights'. \n\nFor an investor who ISN'T investing at your stage, chatting 50 times isn't going to change our minds, it's a fund mandate.\n\nSend updates. Not daily/weekly, but every two weeks/one month update whatsapps (not emails, those are in a graveyard) are VERY powerful. If I think your progress is really strong, I could refer investors to talk to you.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders",

  "text": "Spotting Tailwinds: The Real Edge in Investing\n\nIn the last 3.5 years of investing, after meeting 2000+ companies and 100+ VCs, one insight stands out:\n\nThe biggest winners weren’t just backed because of pedigree founders or well-crafted theses; they scaled because investors pre-empted a tailwind before it was obvious.\n\nThe companies that became category-defining giants always had:\n1) A clear “Why Now” – some inflection point creating urgency.\n2) A simple, painkiller solution – not over-engineered or complicated.\n3) A strong founding team – capable of navigating cycles.\n\nFor example: \n> When D2C brands went digital, Razorpay powered payments.\n> When Account Aggregators reduced TAT & opex, sachetized PL unlocked growth for players like Kissht and KreditBee.\n> As banks digitised, Perfios helped define fintech infra.\n> As savings financialised, Groww (MF-first) and Dhan (FnO-first) witnessed multi-fold growth.\n> Busy working couples gave rise to fast commerce with Zepto and more.\n\nThe pattern is clear:\n 👉 Pre-empt the tailwind → back a simple product solving a painkiller problem → compound with the cycle.\n\nAt Riverwalk, we’ve applied this lens with bets like Elecbits, Aerem, Fantail, Fresh Bus, MarketWolf, and Venwiz, amongst others. \n\nAnd we’re excited about what’s next: from land record digitisation to AI agents, pre-K schools to high-precision manufacturing.\n\nI’ve shared a longer piece on how to think about “Why Now” and the importance of pre-empting tailwinds, with real examples across sectors.\n🔗Link in comments\nIf you’re building in a space where a tailwind is just forming, let’s connect. 🚀\n\nRiverwalk Holdings Satveer Jai Sumer Keshav Avik Ali",

  "text": "Wealth creation for teams. Great leaders are constantly keeping this at the top of their minds.\n\nRecently hosted a few family business friends over, to cover a range of topics, including wealth diversification, alternative assets etc.\n\nThe most critical question from a lot of the new generation is 'how do we retain employees?'\n\nESOPs/Stock was discussed, but it isn't the ideal solution for a private company, especially folks who aren't walking down an IPO path, as there's no liquidity event for the team to create wealth.\n\nOne interesting idea that popped up. \n\nEvery year, whatever profit is earned, after removing what's needed for reinvestment, put a significant portion of that into a 'Pool'. \n\nThis means the Family is giving up a pretty large share of it's profits to this Pool.\n\nThe Pool is invested in safer assets (basket of gold, blue-chip MFs etc) so it grows ~12-15%.\n\nIf an employee leaves after 1 year, they get 20% of their 'share' of the pool.\n\nIf they leave after 5 years, they get 100% of their share, which would have also grown as the profit pool increases + increase in value through investing.\n\nEvery year post 5 is treated as a separate cohort (so employee in year 2 will be working towards a separate cohort for exit in year 6).\n\nIt's an interesting way to reward all employees for loyalty and retention.\n\nOf course, this doesn't take away from rewards and recognition for the highest performers, but it's an additional sweetener to create wealth for the folks who helped build the company.\n\nThoughts?\n\n#startups #familybusiness #rewards",

  "text": "I think I’ve cracked why so many lawyers are sceptical of legal tech.\n\nIt’s not because they don’t understand tech.\nIt’s not because they’re stuck in the past.\n\nIt’s because in their world, trust is currency.\n\nIn law firms and in‑house teams, the stakes are high. You’re not just expected to do good work, you’re expected to do right by your client. \n\nThere are ethical codes, professional standards, and unspoken rules that demand you protect that trust every single day.\n\nNow step into the startup world, and you’ll see, accountability to customers takes a back seat.\n\nI’ve seen founders oversell features just to close a deal.\nI’ve seen sales decks promise a roadmap that doesn’t exist.\n\nAnd lawyers notice.\nThey’ve been burned before.\n\nSo naturally, they come to every vendor conversation with their guard up.\n\nIf you’re building for the legal industry, here’s my take:\nDon’t lead with efficiency metrics and shiny buzzwords.\n\nLead with trust. Lead with proof. \n\nShow them that your customers are not just numbers on a slide, but relationships you’ve earned and kept.\n\nWhat’s the one thing you look for before trusting a new vendor?\n\n#LegalTech #InHouseLegal #TrustMatters #LegalOps #Leadership",

  "text": "If a tree falls in the forest but nobody is around, does it make a sound?\n\nWhile this is an often debated question among philosophy students, late in the evening on a lazy summers day, there's another takeaway to this.\n\nI've met a lot of amazing people and companies in my life. Several have this interesting belief that if you put your head down, build something really amazing, the people will come.\n\nWhile I have a lot of respect for that silent culture, it's not how the world works.\n\nFor those familiar with the story of Tesla Vs Edison, Tesla advocated for AC currents, while Edison was the champion for DC currents.\n\nToday, AC current has become the de facto, proving superior in the VERY long run.\n\nIn the short (their lifetime) run? Edison ran rings around Tesla, discrediting AC currents by highlighting electrocution risks etc.\n\nWhile I'm not an advocate of negative marketing (just a dirty game), positive marketing and brand building are NECESSARY in today's short attention span world.\n\nFrom Law Firms (who really have a challenge since they can't legally advertise) to Missile Makers, content and brand are becoming a must-have, not an afterthought.\n\nMy two cents? The less specialized or subjective you are, the more you need to build a brand.\n\nIf you're offering a service/product that many others do, then the best way to retain and grow your client base is by building a rapport, through a brand they relate to.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders #marketing",

  "text": "Luck be a Lady Tonight - One of my favourite Sinatra tracks, and a topic of great  debate and discussion, Luck itself.\n\nI wanted to take a moment and address a couple of realities here.\n\nPrivilege is real. Someone born in a country with opportunity versus one without.\n\nBeing born healthy versus disabled/sick.\n\nBeing born into a family where food and a roof over one's head are a given, not desperately searched for.\n\nThat's the first form of luck, and one that's decided for you at birth, one that's genuinely out of your control.\n\nThe second form of 'luck' that conventionally breeds jealously or envy, is maximizing serendipity. \n\nThis kind of luck takes effort to create. \n\nI'll pick an example, pre-placement offers today, even at top Unis, are brutally challenging.\n\nA former analyst of mine (and now good friend) asked for help on how to improve their chances. \n\nMy advice? Maximize the surface area of luck. \n\nFigure out EVERY event potential recruiters/hiring managers are going to be at for the next six months. \n\nBeg/borrow/steal the guest list somehow. \n\nLook up each person's name so you can match the face, for your top 10-20 prospects, read more about them, especially what they've spoken about or written publicly. \n\nGo up and make conversation at the event, referencing these.\n\nIn a market where some of the TOP international MBA schools are unable to place more than half the batch, my friend made it happen.\n\nIf you didn't peer at the work under the surface, you'd attribute this to 'luck'.\n\nBut there's a tremendous amount of work that goes to make sure someone's at the right place, the right time, and in the right situation to receive that luck.\n\n#venturecapital #startups #founders #luck",
