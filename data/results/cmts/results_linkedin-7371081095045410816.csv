Luckily for me, I was able to work with them when they moved to different organisations. Bless them for this. 

The most appealing part - when Founders are solving problems they've faced during their careers. I am working on solving - the biggest one to my knowledge is Closure, Client Retention.",2025-09-09T07:37:55.613Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7371081095045410816,7371084427373981696)",avik ashar loved this where their spoc left the companywas transferred etc and the deal went all the way back to the beginning luckily for me i was able to work with them when they moved to different organisations bless them for this the most appealing part when founders are solving problems theyve faced during their careers i am working on solving the biggest one to my knowledge is closure client retention,0.033,0.785,0.182,0.9022,Positive
