Prakash K.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-nx,3rdEngr/2nd Asst Engr| Founder @ NANDIX | Marine Engineer | Building India’s First Autonomous Retail Intelligence Engine | Making Retail Self-Driving Engineer | Adaptive Problem Solver,"AS a founder building a SaaS product, the real battlefield isn’t always the idea or the tech… it's assembling the right core team. Everyone today has commitments, bills, and expectations. Most great talent wants market salaries from day one, but earlystage startups run on conviction long before cash flow. That gap b/w belief and bank balance  is where many founders get crushed.

Finding people who can think like owners, not employees, who’ll build the foundations before the rewards show up… that's the rarest resource in today’s ecosystem. Tech can be learned, distribution can be hacked  but aligning a team that shares the same obsession as the founder is where most SaaS dreams stall....
