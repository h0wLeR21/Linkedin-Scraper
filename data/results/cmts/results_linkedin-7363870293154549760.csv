Girish V,https://www.linkedin.com/in/contactgirish,Founder MonkTrader AI - AWS Accelerator 2025 (Top 100 APAC) | 3x startup founder | Simplifying wealth creation for smart investors,"Brilliant breakdown, Abhishek. The way you’ve framed 'Why Now' around inflection points makes it so clear why some businesses compound while others fade. What’s also interesting is how simple, painkiller solutions always win when a tailwind hits.

I see the same dynamic in retail trading. The tailwind is strong: rising financialisation, younger investors entering earlier, and the demand for disciplined, data-backed decision making. At MonkTrader, this is exactly the shift I’m building for, giving traders tools that simplify and strengthen the process rather than complicate it.",2025-08-22T06:16:15.540Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363870293154549760,7364540893397241856)",brilliant breakdown abhishek the way youve framed why now around inflection points makes it so clear why some businesses compound while others fade whats also interesting is how simple painkiller solutions always win when a tailwind hits i see the same dynamic in retail trading the tailwind is strong rising financialisation younger investors entering earlier and the demand for disciplined databacked decision making at monktrader this is exactly the shift im building for giving traders tools that simplify and strengthen the process rather than complicate it,0.015,0.729,0.256,0.9734,Positive

Spotting the tailwind before it’s obvious is less about luck and more about seeing patterns others miss.
