Sanket Shanishchara,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ca-sanket-shanishchara,Investment Banking | Private Wealth | Arambh Ventures,"Wage gaps - that forces people towards such urban centers. In mumbai itself - the wage gap between Nariman Point and Andheri is large, and even larger between Andheri and Vasai - Virar. This is just a distance of 30 - 40 kms for each pair. It is because the old money is concentrated in such centers, and as far as I understand - tax incentives won't cut it for them. The ecosystem is anchored to this wealth. And to change the urban density - this money needs to move out. So called real estate mafias - they have been developing distance suburbs of Mumbai for almost 2 decades now.

Still, Mumbai has done a much better job in the last 10-15 years in bridging this gap, and a lot of large offices have moved to suburbs from south bombay. And considering Navi Mumbai was set up to ease the burden on Mumbai - it's limited success makes the transition look very slow and virtually ineffective.

This wage gap looks particularly painful in the context of the rising ambition of the young population, and thus the large migration towards mega urban centers.
