Nizaam khan,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nizaam-khan-7a96b0291,"Entrepreneur | Founder @ Adventroz – Travel. Culture. Legacy. | Helping Founders Build Smarter With Tech, Marketing & Capital","Exactly Avik Ashar India’s fintech story isn’t just about apps or payments, it’s about creating an ecosystem that works for everyone, from first-time users to seasoned investors. A few points stand out:
1. UPI as infrastructure, not just a product: 654 million transactions daily is not a number, it’s a massive behavior shift. It’s proof that seamless, reliable infrastructure drives adoption faster than any marketing push.
2. Cross-border integration: Enabling links with countries like France, Singapore, and UAE is a textbook example of turning domestic success into global influence without reinventing the wheel.
3. Democratization of finance: Platforms like Zerodha, Groww, Lendingkart, and Slice are doing more than transactions they’re bringing financial literacy and inclusion at scale, creating the base for a robust domestic capital market.
4. Fintech + impact: Companies like Aerem show that fintech isn’t limited to payments or loans it can enable sustainability, SME growth, and social impact while remaining commercially viable.
