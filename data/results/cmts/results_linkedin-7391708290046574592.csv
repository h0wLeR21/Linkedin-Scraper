Dietrich created FOMO before it was a buzzword Avik Ashar. Also, human nature is such that it gravitates towards what is prohibited. There's a certain thrill to it. 

Also, even today, the moment you say Exclusive or Only On Invite (some sort of barrier), people want in. Being part of an elite community somehow plays into our need to be a part of it.

More & more people are giving up alcohol, but then it's too awkward to be out at a party or a club with nothing in your hand. A coffee or tea feels fairly random. So guess who is winning in that space too?

They built a mythology.
They turned a commodity drink into a cultural asset by manufacturing perception long before manufacturing demand.
That’s why competitors copy the product, but never the meaning.",2025-11-05T05:36:22.948Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7391708290046574592,7391709948059189248)",red bull didnt build a beverage brand they built a mythology they turned a commodity drink into a cultural asset by manufacturing perception long before manufacturing demand thats why competitors copy the product but never the meaning,0.037,0.912,0.051,0.128,Positive
