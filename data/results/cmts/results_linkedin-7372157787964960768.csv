It’s been months of pushing over one idea / offer and another and not finding a new idea to be part of and while I am well-paced at saying yes / no - in some cases Yes’ and No’s are in the pipeline. 

And usually when I don’t hear from someone I write to them to give me a clear response as that’s the right way to close a conversation. No bad feelings really! 

Thank you for this post. Gonna close on these pending right away.

Thinking in these extremes is what ""transactional sales people"" often do - and they should - because that is their job.
