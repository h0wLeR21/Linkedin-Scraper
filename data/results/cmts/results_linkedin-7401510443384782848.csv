One thought that may unlock a new revenue stream...

In Tier-2 and Tier-3 India, a large percentage of households don’t use standard bed sizes they either buy custom cots or get them made by local carpenters. This often creates a psychological friction for premium mattress buyers because they feel 'standard' mattresses may not perfectly fit.

If The Sleep Company introduced a ""Custom fit Program"" ..where a visit / measurement support / or a ₹xxx voucher for local cot resizing is bundled with the mattress purchase it eliminates this barrier completely. 

Mattress purchase would move from product choice to #homefitsolution. That single shift can increase conversion rates dramatically, especially in markets where disposable income is growing but customization mindset is high.....

Just a thought that might accelerate penetration beyond the metros. hope this adds value.....",2025-12-02T07:36:49.668Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7401510443384782848,7401524731491082240)",amazing journey and an even more impressive category creation one thought that may unlock a new revenue stream in tier and tier india a large percentage of households dont use standard bed sizes they either buy custom cots or get them made by local carpenters this often creates a psychological friction for premium mattress buyers because they feel standard mattresses may not perfectly fit if the sleep company introduced a custom fit program where a visit measurement support or a xxx voucher for local cot resizing is bundled with the mattress purchase it eliminates this barrier completely mattress purchase would move from product choice to homefitsolution that single shift can increase conversion rates dramatically especially in markets where disposable income is growing but customization mindset is high just a thought that might accelerate penetration beyond the metros hope this adds value,0.045,0.821,0.134,0.9026,Positive
