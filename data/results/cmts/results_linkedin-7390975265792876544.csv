Srinivas R.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinivasramanjulu,"Aligning Strategy, People & Delivery for Growth | 25+ Years Driving Brand & Business Outcomes | Calm Clarity, Lasting Impact","Entrepreneurs today have diverse options for funding and the risk appetite is higher compared to bygone years. The biggest gap I find is new startups missing in the sector that requires large investment or requires immense hardwork like say manufacturing. I might be wrong here. 

With Shark Tank giving the startups required visibility, we should start seeing more businesses from the tier 2, tier 3 areas coming into the limelight.

And the biggest segment where startups are required is: agriculture. Agriculture should be brought in the limelight, encourage youngsters to take up farming, cost reduction and increase in revenue per acre should give relief to farmer parents on the future.

The startup still gets a deal from the remaining one judge.
