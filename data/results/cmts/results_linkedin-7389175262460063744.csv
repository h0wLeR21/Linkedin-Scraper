Everyone wants to scale, but few realize scale without retention is just churn in disguise.
Retention is proof of product-market fit. Acquisition is proof of marketing fit.
If your old customers aren’t buying again, your funnel isn’t growing, it’s leaking.

Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"People often confuse upselling models with supermarket models. (More common in B2C)

Just because you have users using your product, through a digital / offline / omni channel, does not mean you can sell them new categories or even new emotional values within the same category.

Examples : Selling Insurance or personal loan to a saving customer is not upselling, it is new sales which is as costly (or costlier).as acquiring a new customer for that category. It is more easy to sell fashion jewellery (5k to 20k) to a micro saving customer than sell them cultural jewellery (1 lac to 10 lac). But a buy-now-pay-later only for jewellery  with average ticket size of 5 lacs is a much easier product to upsell, if your customers are already subscribing 10,000 pm on gold savings. 

Dove as a brand cannot upsell or cross sell a fairness cream and that is why the same company has two separate brands.

An MSME owner who trusts you to hold his gold balance for 20 years (for his daughter's marriage) will easily trust you to keep his family jewellery at your branch (which he can check in&out 6 AM to 11 PM), in return for working Capital credit that he can leverage for his business - even though it appears to be two completely different businesses.",2025-10-29T06:19:57.981Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389175262460063744,7389184201243389953)",people often confuse upselling models with supermarket models more common in bc just because you have users using your product through a digital offline omni channel does not mean you can sell them new categories or even new emotional values within the same category examples selling insurance or personal loan to a saving customer is not upselling it is new sales which is as costly or costlieras acquiring a new customer for that category it is more easy to sell fashion jewellery k to k to a micro saving customer than sell them cultural jewellery lac to lac but a buynowpaylater only for jewellery with average ticket size of lacs is a much easier product to upsell if your customers are already subscribing pm on gold savings dove as a brand cannot upsell or cross sell a fairness cream and that is why the same company has two separate brands an msme owner who trusts you to hold his gold balance for years for his daughters marriage will easily trust you to keep his family jewellery at your branch which he can check inout am to pm in return for working capital credit that he can leverage for his business even though it appears to be two completely different businesses,0.018,0.871,0.111,0.9688,Positive
