The problem is with those who claim to back early-stage startups,  at idea stage, MVP, even pre-revenue  and proudly list their “thesis sectors"" but then reject founders saying they need more traction or min x MRR/ARR.

Curious to know if there are retrospective meetings later on if someone missed a 100X or 1000X return. Like some players in sports don’t get drafted and find a team later - and become superstars. But just wondering if there are retrospective meetings later as a protocol? Because it is all good saying we will do A number for Stage 1 and B number for Stage 2 - but surely it also depends on the situations - like you see a 1000X potential but have already capped for that stage.
