Devarsh Saraf,https://www.linkedin.com/in/devarshsaraf,Building Bombay Founders Club,"In India’s current listed-equity boom, I’m seeing more and more family offices treat VC as a “nice to have” – or worse, a bad asset class.

That’s dangerous myopia.

If LPs only chase liquid, listed upside, who funds the next wave of Indian category-creators before they become listed giants?

If we’re serious about India’s innovation story, we need to make early-stage risk capital structurally attractive:
- Tax incentives / pass-through benefits for LPs backing regulated VC funds
- Clearer, faster regulations around AIFs and exits
- A coordinated push from Indian Venture and Alternate Capital Association (IVCA) + founder-led associations to get this on the policy agenda

Otherwise, we drift toward a world where early-stage founders are told:
“Bootstrap, take debt, or don’t build.”

That’s not how you build the next generation of Indian unicorns — that’s how you miss them.",2025-11-21T10:15:58.581Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7397535527647928321,7397578516017352704)",in indias current listedequity boom im seeing more and more family offices treat vc as a nice to have or worse a bad asset class thats dangerous myopia if lps only chase liquid listed upside who funds the next wave of indian categorycreators before they become listed giants if were serious about indias innovation story we need to make earlystage risk capital structurally attractive tax incentives passthrough benefits for lps backing regulated vc funds clearer faster regulations around aifs and exits a coordinated push from indian venture and alternate capital association ivca founderled associations to get this on the policy agenda otherwise we drift toward a world where earlystage founders are told bootstrap take debt or dont build thats not how you build the next generation of indian unicorns thats how you miss them,0.113,0.757,0.13,0.3744,Positive
