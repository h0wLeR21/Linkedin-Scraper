Tristram H.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tristram-hawthorn-cogseb,Partner at Employee Benefits Collective,"Well done Mark Miller - as to the closing question, parametric forecasting and AI analytics could be used on far broader ranges of risk than weather and I would guess that many insurers will be keeping an eye on what you and the team are doing and watching with interest. Shaking up the insurance industry is difficult in an environment where 20+ year horizons are the norm. Hence the slew of insure-tech failures where investors tend to see tech and think ""fast, agile, risky returns"", but miss the insurance part; ""slow, ponderous, mid range returns with scope for black swan losses"". However, the changes afoot in vehicular automation, means that you've a fantastic chance of leading a seismic shift.
