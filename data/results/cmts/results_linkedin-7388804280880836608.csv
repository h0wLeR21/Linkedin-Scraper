Instead of helping customers see the value of the product, they are happy to diminish the worth of their product and brand.
 
Let me share the exact words of one of the founders I recently encountered. He said, ""I want only rich and premium people to buy our product, it should have a luxury vibe........ and yes, let's give a 30% discount offer too.""
 
The pandemic of discounting has the 3rd most common excuse, ""Indians are price sensitive, they don't buy without discounts.""
 
I have also seen discounts significantly impact returns and cancellations. When these ""founders"" rely on discounts as a core strategy due to desperation and FOMO, they are left questioning why their brand lacks trust and respect.
