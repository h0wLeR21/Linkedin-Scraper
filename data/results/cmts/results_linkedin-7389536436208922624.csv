Natascha Alicia Møller-Palacino,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nataschaalicia-moellerpalacino,I help biotech founders secure funding faster | Stay ahead of the curve | Land investor conversations that lead to a “yes” | Cand.Scient.Med.,"Such an important distinction and one I see all the time when coaching biotech founders. Many approach investors as if they’re submitting a grant proposal focused on data, hypotheses, and long-term potential instead of communicating like business leaders.
Investors don’t fund exploration; they fund execution. What separates the ones who get a “yes” is clarity, on how the science translates into value distribution, cost advantage, and scalability.
In my experience, the turning point often comes when founders start thinking like storytellers, not scientists. The story isn’t about what’s in the lab, it’s about how that science moves through the market and impacts lives. That’s when the conversation changes completely.",2025-10-30T08:47:41.481Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389536436208922624,7389583765322321920)",such an important distinction and one i see all the time when coaching biotech founders many approach investors as if theyre submitting a grant proposal focused on data hypotheses and longterm potential instead of communicating like business leaders investors dont fund exploration they fund execution what separates the ones who get a yes is clarity on how the science translates into value distribution cost advantage and scalability in my experience the turning point often comes when founders start thinking like storytellers not scientists the story isnt about whats in the lab its about how that science moves through the market and impacts lives thats when the conversation changes completely,0.014,0.804,0.182,0.9519,Positive
