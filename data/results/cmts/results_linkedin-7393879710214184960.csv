Cutting through the noise, quite elegantly I must say.

For me their value proposition was clear when my new glasses by John Jacobs (Lenskart.com) became the talk of the town in EMC at Insead.

Ambar Raj,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambarraj,Founder @Wild Oak | Building D2C Body-Care Brand | Carlson MBA’17 | Ex-Product & Strategy,"Completely agree on the customer experience and long term potential - no doubt Lenskart is building something strong. But valuation isn’t about whether they’ll grow or has great customer experience. It’s about how much of that growth is already priced in. 

How far into the future has the market already factored their growth? 5 years, 10, or 20?

When you invest as a VC in startups at very early stage, there is a chance revenues / profits can grow 10X, 100X even then they are not valued at 10X revenue normally.
