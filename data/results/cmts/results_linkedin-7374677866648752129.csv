Ajit Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajit-kumar-ints,Open to work.,"Idk, but something is off about your approach to finding. Unless we are talking about just access to capital. 

your play book doesn’t sound like it’s best fit for VC, rather for PE. Of course you have every right to expect great returns. But simply expecting that doesn’t make one a VC, unless the very definition of it has changed. 

what you are talking about is minimising there risk of investment and maximising returns. What VCs, the great ones, are known for is to spot great potential and consequently great returns. No one ever invests clearly knowing something is wrong or could be wrong. 

for all the attributes you have rejected funding and aren’t keen, others have invested. 

You are free, absolutely to invest in anywhere you wish to, and trust me no one owes you anything for your efforts. That’s on you. But when people read and internalise these opinions, it creates a culture that has been the central motif (not necessarily healthy), of Indian VC. 

all I would do is wait for a decade, if I am alive and see how your portfolio has done",2025-09-19T06:38:40.460Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7374677866648752129,7374693394637324289)",idk but something is off about your approach to finding unless we are talking about just access to capital your play book doesnt sound like its best fit for vc rather for pe of course you have every right to expect great returns but simply expecting that doesnt make one a vc unless the very definition of it has changed what you are talking about is minimising there risk of investment and maximising returns what vcs the great ones are known for is to spot great potential and consequently great returns no one ever invests clearly knowing something is wrong or could be wrong for all the attributes you have rejected funding and arent keen others have invested you are free absolutely to invest in anywhere you wish to and trust me no one owes you anything for your efforts thats on you but when people read and internalise these opinions it creates a culture that has been the central motif not necessarily healthy of indian vc all i would do is wait for a decade if i am alive and see how your portfolio has done,0.124,0.646,0.231,0.9866,Positive
