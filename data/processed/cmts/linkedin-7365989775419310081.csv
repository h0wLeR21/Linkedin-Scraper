Not just the goodwill is at play, the Law is watertight to drag the BCCI into violation of section 6 of the Act. 

They will be liable for “cause to be made, aid, abet …” the marketing of the online money game.

Dream11 can continue their international operations barring India, but can BCCI keep them as sponsor? A simple “No” is the answer.

Sometimes it’s the game of risk, which is in fine print, appears as gesture of Goodwill.

Totally agree with you that the weakest contractual link is your best protection. Assess and make sure the protection runs through all contracts in similar way.

Most companies have NDAs where they are liable for higher protection, while their NDA has lower level of protection, exposing them to risk.

Secondly, I believe that BCCI should have already made 2/3 of the 3 year contract value as the contract was supposed to terminate next year.

I think BCCI gained in this and D11 didn’t lose. BCCI’s gain: India has Asia Cup and women WC coming up and this gives the opportunity to BCCI to revisit the deal and make more money.",2025-08-26T13:53:59.813Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7365989775419310081,7366105638369726465)"

I remember when many gaming companies were raising funds over the last decade; both founders and investors recognized regulation as a grey area and were mindful of the potential risks ahead. It’s encouraging to see Dream11 factoring real regulatory risks into their documentation and BCCI, as the counterparty, responding with equal maturity.

Rahul D.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahuldronam,Planting 3.5 Million Trees in 2025.,"The Ovi OTA launch that Apalya did for the IPL was such an important milestone. It may not have received the attention that many of the later breakthroughs in digital did in India, but those of us at Apalya at the time know how much innovative problem-solving went into the day-to-day. I still remember when we crossed 30,000 concurrent sessions, a number we had only stress-tested for. Watching it happen live, with no dip in video quality on 3G, was a huge moment for us.

Whether it was delivering firsts for telcos, working with OEMs like Samsung and Blackberry, or building set-top box projects from Nigeria to Indonesia, each initiative brought its own unique challenges with no prior playbook to follow. Navigating hundreds of early Android versions, meeting telco requirements to keep apps under 5MB (and in one case under 1MB!!), or debugging why a stream worked in one part of Mumbai but not in another, on the exact same device, all of it built root-cause thinking and client management skills that I still rely on today. (Updating burnt-on apps in Sri Lanka...I can write a whole post about just that!)

Since this post is about lessons learned, I just wanted to share that I’ll always be grateful for having been part of that journey. ",2025-08-26T07:22:37.937Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7365989775419310081,7366007148243255296)"
