Nitin Mathur,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tinmathur,Startups| Strategy| Data| Tech| Product| Non Profits,"You have a great point there. If no one knows what you have, you can have the greatest product in the world and no one to use it.
However, in the startup context, to my mind, in practice the bigger challenges currently are:
1. A lot of products and services are copycats, or 'cool', and whether what they solve for and how is really what the user is looking for, willing and able to afford is a question mark. So the assumption that you have a great product or service is questionable. And marketing it widely might just hasten your demise.
2. On the other hand the core challenge for startups is the limited resources: time, specialised talent, and money. . So what would be useful is to help them identify the one or two things they can do that are most likely to create the maximum impact, with the minimum possible  effort, money, and friction. And when coupled with a list of things being currently done that can be stopped - to save time, money and heartburn, and release capacity for the new, it would make for a more compelling proposition.
Maybe that's where Marketers could focus?",2025-08-14T14:46:21.716Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7361647910855364608,7361770162078851072)"

Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"Many founders mistake high decibel ""communications"" as marketing and brand building. A flamboyant play boy may be successful in short term dates, but long term relationships require a different kind of approach. Marketing is often assumed to be same as pushing.. your product, your company and your narrative, but brand building counter intuitively is about increasing the pull so that you don't have to push. Get someone to get interested in you, in learning more about you, for which you should first show genuine interest in understanding them.

Brand building is no different than relationship building. And any relationship requires authenticity and honesty in messaging who you are, and what you stand for and what kind of promise and commitments you are offering and how you will stand by them.",2025-08-14T11:17:30.171Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7361647910855364608,7361717600973721601)"
