India’s venture story is finally moving from chasing valuations to creating validation.",2025-10-08T18:30:17.399Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7381550664771956736,7381757848025882624)"

Legacy. | Helping Founders Build Smarter With Tech, Marketing & Capital","Avik Ashar I think the real inflection point isn’t the $50B market cap, it’s trust returning to the ecosystem.
For years, Indian venture ran on belief and burn. Now, it’s running on proof and liquidity.
Once capital recycles back to LPs, it stops being “venture gambling” and becomes an asset class.
And that changes everything: valuations sober up, LP pools deepen, and founders start optimizing for durability, not drama.
India isn’t just minting IPOs, it’s minting confidence.",2025-10-08T15:52:16.264Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7381550664771956736,7381718081263497218)"
Vivek Kumar,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekumar13,"Startups, Branding, marketing, and culture. I have failed enough to help build startups the “right way”.","It's a tough job :) Avik Ashar. 

Using other people's money on others for a promise of better return than other options in the market is by far the toughest job. I feel. 

You are serving two customers : Your LPs and Entrepreneurs. 

It takes insane amount of mind space ",2025-10-08T06:11:26.418Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7381550664771956736,7381571910414864384)"
Fahad Fazil,https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahadfazil,Co-Founder & CTO | Building Devize — The Business OS for Modern Enterprises,"Avik Ashar A sharp and much-needed perspective on what true ecosystem maturity looks like. IPOs don’t just validate founders — they validate venture capital as a credible, scalable asset class in India. The liquidity flowing back to founders, employees, and LPs marks the beginning of a self-sustaining cycle. This isn’t just growth; it’s generational compounding for India’s innovation economy.
