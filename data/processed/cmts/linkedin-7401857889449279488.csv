Rohan C.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron128,"TMH | ISB | NISM i DeRisk Healthcare Investments for founders & funders, enabling profitable exits & scaled returns.","IMHO the problem stems from a lack of understanding what a founder is & knowing when to let go- one of the hardest things ever. I very often come across folks who do not understand the distinction between the company and self. Ask them to put up a CEO who is not on the company board & comes the resistance but why? The founder very often thinks they & the company are one & the same. It's very hard to get this mindset out of their psyche to try & convince them that given the fact that they themselves are the largest shareholders it will be in their best interests to see independent governance that does what's best for the company. It is at this point where I see the conflict growing- what may be best for the company may not be the best for the founder.  I for instance am not on the board of directors for my own company, I understand my limitations & i best live it to wiser heads to take operational & financial decisions. I chart the board in the right direction with nudges but after that it's completely their call, they are collectively the best people to act on without any biases that I may have. And I have seen ample proof that's the best way to grow, when you have clear insights no biases and clear goals.",2025-12-03T07:29:40.477Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7401857889449279488,7401885319203012608)"
