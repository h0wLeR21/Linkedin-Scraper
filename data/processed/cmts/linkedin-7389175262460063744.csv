You already have a client who is familiar with you and your team, your business and the systems. And is getting the desired results, the icing on the cake will be if you can create sufficient hunger in them for growth. This can be the fuel for your growth too.

Unfortunately most of the businesses run for new clients and ignore the gold in hand..",2025-10-29T07:35:29.597Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389175262460063744,7389203208218267649)"

Everyone wants to scale, but few realize scale without retention is just churn in disguise.
Retention is proof of product-market fit. Acquisition is proof of marketing fit.
If your old customers aren’t buying again, your funnel isn’t growing, it’s leaking.
The best founders I’ve met treat existing users like investors: they keep them updated, make them feel part of the journey, and always deliver more value than expected.
The day your existing customers start bringing you new ones, that’s when you’ve actually achieved growth.",2025-10-29T07:32:47.622Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389175262460063744,7389202528850272256)"

When you statistically look at it too, businesses start making profits only when the customer does repeat purchases. The 1st transaction is never profitable. And unless you build a system to enure repeat buys, you'll always end up with a one-off purchase by customers.

Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"People often confuse upselling models with supermarket models. (More common in B2C)

Just because you have users using your product, through a digital / offline / omni channel, does not mean you can sell them new categories or even new emotional values within the same category.

Examples : Selling Insurance or personal loan to a saving customer is not upselling, it is new sales which is as costly (or costlier).as acquiring a new customer for that category. It is more easy to sell fashion jewellery (5k to 20k) to a micro saving customer than sell them cultural jewellery (1 lac to 10 lac). But a buy-now-pay-later only for jewellery  with average ticket size of 5 lacs is a much easier product to upsell, if your customers are already subscribing 10,000 pm on gold savings. 

Dove as a brand cannot upsell or cross sell a fairness cream and that is why the same company has two separate brands.

An MSME owner who trusts you to hold his gold balance for 20 years (for his daughter's marriage) will easily trust you to keep his family jewellery at your branch (which he can check in&out 6 AM to 11 PM), in return for working Capital credit that he can leverage for his business - even though it appears to be two completely different businesses.",2025-10-29T06:19:57.981Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389175262460063744,7389184201243389953)"

kodak had GREAT retention. right until instagram happened. sometimes the best customer strategy is making your old ones irrelevant.",2025-10-29T05:55:29.316Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7389175262460063744,7389178041220083712)"
