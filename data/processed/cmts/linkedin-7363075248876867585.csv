If the poster didn't invoke Dubai and Singapore, what is the fault in his conclusions? (Assuming he didn't end up saying Mumbai is the best airport in the world)",2025-08-23T02:46:45.786Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363075248876867585,7364850559893258241)"

""What gets measured, can also be gamed""

I think the highly competitive nature in India leads you to this path eventually, especially if you stay in the game too long, rigidly (without pivoting)

I honestly think that 100% honest people don't prosper in India, the game is such,

Or you have to be around roughly 400% better (than the competition) to be honest and succeed.

People in India succeed despite their honesty, never because of it, 

there is a huge misalignment in incentives and it's so hard to fix.

Because so many people are fighting against hunger and basic sustenance. They never want to innately be dishonest, but the high competition (& population) often makes them distort a few facts here and there. Especially while playing high volume games.

Honesty and transparency is a big luxury (and premium), in the end.",2025-08-19T04:03:43.519Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7363075248876867585,7363420376606900227)"

That's why you need an outsider perspective. Someone to validate your assumptions and fight your bias
