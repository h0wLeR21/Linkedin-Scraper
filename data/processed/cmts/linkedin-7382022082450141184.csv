Building trust, relationships, and social capital before raising or selling is what separates founders who just start from those who scale. Social capital isn’t fluff; it’s the real moat for any startup.

Shailendra Kaka,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shailendrakaka,I Engineer only 3 Fasting Outcomes:🔹A Lean Body🔹A Sharp Mind🔹Mental Peace ✅I design strategic protocols that make FASTING pain-free✅Fast Without Fear ✅Get rid of Chronic Obesity ✅Less Noise; Clearer Signal.,"Devarsh Saraf   Thinking you can launch a product and then build the community is like trying to plant a massive banyan tree in the middle of a barren desert and then hoping the rain will somehow show up.

As a Fasting Strategist, I see this exact same principle in biology. Clients come to me wanting a dramatic, 'overnight' transformation in their health. They are focused on the ""launch"" of their new body. But they have not spent any time preparing the ""network""—the internal cellular environment that actually allows for real, sustainable change.

💚 A product launch without a pre-built community is like expecting a harvest from a field where you never took the time to sow the seeds. The silence is deafening, and the failure is inevitable.",2025-10-10T01:38:46.633Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7382022082450141184,7382228068234346497)"

Social capital compounds like interest, it’s invisible until it isn’t.
You can’t buy it, automate it, or fake it; you earn it by showing up before you need anything.
