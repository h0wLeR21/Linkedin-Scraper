It's astonishing to see how many folks reach out without even a look at the company website, thesis, or even the profile of the person you're talking to. 

In today's world of AI, it's so easy to learn anything, literally. You just need to be curious enough. When someone reaches out and asks the most basic things, it just gives lazy. They want to be spoonfed - instead, have an opinion and utilize your connection with people from the industry to share their thoughts and opinions, that's what keeps people interested in you.",2025-10-16T07:30:04.605Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7384457317427245056,7384490802850258945)"
