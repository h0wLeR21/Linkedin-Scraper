Jitender Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jitnder,Helping Founders & SMBs Build Powerful Brand Narratives with AI-Powered Strategy 🧠💡✨,"""Open sourcing the narrative engine."" <— That is a brilliant community move, Avik Ashar! ✍️🔓

From a Content Strategy perspective, this shifts the dynamic from Broadcast (One-to-Many) to Co-Creation (Many-to-Many). 🎙️🤝

Most creators guess what the audience wants. You are letting them hold the pen. That is the difference between an Audience and a Tribe.

As a Narrative Strategist who lives in the headspace of founders daily, I’d love to bring that ""Story Architecture"" lens to the room.
