The shift from hype-driven investing to disciplined allocation is exactly what separates long-term wealth builders from market tourists. Loved the reminder that access, patience, and selection — not timing — define real returns.

I think VC funds as an asset class are fairly nascent in India still - both in the depth n breadth of the offering as well as the appetite and understanding even by institutional / sophisticated allocators.

The recent changes on accreditation will make fund selection / manager selection even more important as while funding will get slightly harder - especially at the earliest stages, there will also be an opportunity to get more attractive entry points and higher quality deal flow if you’re betting on the right fund / manager. 

The next decade might shape and see a transformation in this space in India IMHO!",2025-10-01T14:52:34.588Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7379037800849059840,7379166343570345984)"

Shekhar Chatterjee,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekharchatterjee,Building PoloPan | AI x Consumer Tech x Commerce,"To go direct or via a VC is similar to going to public equities via mutual funds or direct investment. Quality control of the investment (even post investment) is the missing element that VCs solve for. But something isn't clicking that well in the India story as of now like it does in the west.

I think the current venture capital model needs to be tweaked a bit more in a sense that the model should make that 2% money out of a deal rather than a annual fee. The annual subscription fee on their entire undeployed capital is a deterrent to raising a fund of decent size to deploy. If ventures can be asset light, VCs can be too!",2025-10-01T09:46:57.014Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7379037800849059840,7379089430206140416)"

Median funds don’t beat public markets top-decile funds do, and they capture nearly all the excess returns. Preqin’s own data shows over 60% of VC funds globally underperform the NASDAQ.
