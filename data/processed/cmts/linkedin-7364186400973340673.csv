Sayanee Bhowmik,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sayaneebhowmik,Ex - VC | Startup Mentor | Simplifying Fundraising on Linkedin & Substack,"I’ve seen founders waste weeks trying to ‘network’ their way into meetings without a clear ask and honestly, it rarely works. Early-stage founders often think persistence alone changes fund mandates, but understanding the VC’s focus and fund mandate is equally important. If Founders understood VC economics, it would save so much of time on either side. ",2025-08-22T05:36:08.396Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7364186400973340673,7364530797103472641)"
