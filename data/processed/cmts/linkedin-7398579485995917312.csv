The strange part is how the entire engine runs on vanity metrics like Active Users and Revenue per User, even when the product is free or priced so low that profitability becomes mathematically impossible. But the story sells, rounds keep coming, and post-money valuations keep skyrocketing.

And here’s the kicker — with every new round, earlier investors still make money on paper. So if customers get the product free, founders get the capital, and VCs keep marking up their books… who’s really complaining?
