It’s been months of pushing over one idea / offer and another and not finding a new idea to be part of and while I am well-paced at saying yes / no - in some cases Yes’ and No’s are in the pipeline. 

And usually when I don’t hear from someone I write to them to give me a clear response as that’s the right way to close a conversation. No bad feelings really! 

Thank you for this post. Gonna close on these pending right away. Should make for a lighter weekend 😜",2025-09-12T19:55:05.603Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7372157787964960768,7372357104994619392)"

Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"As a marketer who has done both B2B and B2C, a clear No / Unsubscribe helps but the absence of it is neither hopeless nor hopeful.  Thinking in these extremes is what ""transactional sales people"" often do - and they should - because that is their job. 

Whereas for  a person who is responsible for marketing and product management it is much more complex.

Like Mathematicians would say, there is a multi dimensional solution space with a definite path from No and May be to Yes and Action with a deep valley of indifferent silence in between.  And that path passes through your product, its alternatives, messaging and many unconscious subconscious emotions which the customer herself is not aware of.",2025-09-12T09:52:14.524Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7372157787964960768,7372205392493252608)"
