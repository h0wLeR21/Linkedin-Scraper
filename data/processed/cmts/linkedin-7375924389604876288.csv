A great perspective it is. No one perspective serves everyone though. 

Like you said. Some people prefer building momentum with easy first wins. 

Depending on where you're on this path, whatever serves you is advised. 

The key thing however is that you set your priorities such that whatever you set out to do is accomplished on the day no matter what happens.

Because THINGS don't happen suddenly. THINGS happen with little incremental inputs that over time gives you gargantum results. 

Block out pockets of action. What you make time for decides what you spend your time on.",2025-11-09T16:53:39.654Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7375924389604876288,7393329942220128257)"

Cristian Nichifor,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-nichifor,"Problem-solver at the intersection of ops, tech & people | Building systems that scale, workflows that work, and experiences that stick.","Eating frogs is great advice, but maybe it’s time Coda, as a product, became the frog on your to-do list.

As a long-time power user, it’s honestly frustrating to watch these productivity philosophies get shared while core product development has stagnated for years. We’ve been asking for better permissions, a mobile app that is in line with 2025, basic things. Not even ""nice-to-haves"" anymore. Shall I mention Microsoft Edge or ""Coda Brain""?

Instead, we get more metaphors and fewer updates. The risk isn’t that users stop caring, it’s that they start leaving. And that slow bleed is harder to reverse than just sitting down and doing the work.",2025-09-22T16:59:16.369Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7375924389604876288,7375936736956317697)"
