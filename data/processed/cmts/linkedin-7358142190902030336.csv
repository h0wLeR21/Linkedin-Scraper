Ivan Lebedev,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivan-lebedev-llm,"Senior ICT Lawyer | AI, Data & Privacy Compliance | Contributor on Digital Innovation & Governance","Agree - trust is the cornerstone of the legal mindset, and for good reason. But I’d add: the best path to trusting innovation like AI isn’t just slick demos or vendor promises — it’s hands-on fluency. Not just using a tool, but understanding how it works, where it breaks, and how to build in safeguards. When lawyers start thinking like AI engineers — asking hard questions, testing outputs, stress-testing assumptions — that’s when trust becomes real. The lawyer who knows how the system thinks is the one who can rely on it. That’s where the future is.",2025-08-14T12:39:59.155Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7358142190902030336,7361738358512840704)"

And that really landed with me. 

What if one of the reason lawyers are 'different' than other professionals is actually US??? Their UIs have been nearly non-existent, we made them search using boolean logic, and we told them ""No"" for more than a decade.

PagerFox,,18 followers,"It's the same reason that lawyers love to start with their own forms or samples: they know those documents are vetted, and they don't have to be worried about all of the intentional or unintentional traps that might live in someone else's document. So if you want lawyers to adopt a new tool (which is effectively someone else's document), you have to prove to them that new tool's work product is just as trustworthy as their own documents.

I always ask has the tech been designed with these principles. That’s why it’s deeply concerning to see legal professionals relying on generic AI tools for due diligence, drafting legal documents, and client meetings. These tools are NOT built for the unique demands of the law. I still don’t understand how some are submitting filings without cite-checking. Case law can change within 1-4 hours. Regulations and statutes can be amended just as fast. This was a basic tenet of legal research when I started.
I recently spoke with a VC analyst who was using generic AI to review deal documents. I was stunned. When I worked at a global investment bank, deal docs were protected like a fortress. A single leak could jeopardize the transaction, damage reputations, lead to SEC violations, and most importantly, harm the client. Yet in the age of AI, these safeguards are being dismissed.

Prakhar P.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakharpandey92,Tech Policy + Economic Development | India Qualified Lawyer,"This really resonates and love this take. Aligns with my own and my former colleagues’ experience with certain LegalTech tools. The skepticism was less about resistance to innovation and more about what you captured so well: trust. And actually, somewhat behavioral as well.

In high-pressure environments where the margin for error is very low, minor glitches can feel intolerable. The moment a tool makes an error, the instinctive reaction is: ""It would’ve been faster and safer if I’d just done it myself."" After one bad experience, the tool is often not used again. Once bitten, twice shy.

With so many pitching some form of automation and/or ""agentic AI"" tool, I wouldn't be surprised if lawyers and law firms approach LegalTech firms with great suspicion. A deeper understanding of the customer’s context and of your own company’s technology, not just sales strategies, might go a long way in building trust and winning lawyers over as clients. That said, my insight is based on limited engagement with LegalTech companies in the United States, so it may well have its own blind spots.",2025-08-04T20:36:08.420Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7358142190902030336,7358234308039372802)"
