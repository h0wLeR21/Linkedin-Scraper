Dumanlal Sethi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dumanlalsethi,Transforming land into opportunity Real Estate & Sand Mining Ventures,"Absolutely agree — saying No is underrated but so powerful. 🙌
It’s fascinating how this shows up across sales, startups, and fundraising: clarity and decisiveness cut through the noise, save time, and help everyone focus on what really matters.
A well-timed No isn’t rejection — it’s respect for your priorities and for others’ time. Learning to give it gracefully is one of the hardest but most valuable skills in business and life. 💡Avik Ashar",2025-11-07T03:28:33.204Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7392076363198967808,7392402554552471552)"

Rupesh Maheshwari,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ca-rupesh-maheshwari,"CFO at Jio Haptik - Subsidiary of Jio Platforms | Strategy, Finance & Investor Relations","Spot on. Having pitched to multiple VCs in my earlier roles, one key learning is to always identify and talk to the real decision maker early. Otherwise, you can get caught in endless loops of “internal discussions” with no real progress. The time you save here often decides the velocity of your fundraise.",2025-11-06T19:05:08.248Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7392076363198967808,7392275865784475650)"
