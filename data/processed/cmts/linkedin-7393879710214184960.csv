If Lenskart sustains its supply chain edge and brand moat, it’ll earn that premium over time. ",2025-11-12T07:14:14.721Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7393879710214184960,7394271291123527680)"

Farhan Jaorewalla,https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhan-jaorewalla-a2841316a,COO at Bombay Founders' Club,Interesting take on Lenskart's IPO. I've seen firsthand how much my folks love the Lenskart experience-it's built real trust.

Cutting through the noise, quite elegantly I must say.

For me their value proposition was clear when my new glasses by John Jacobs (Lenskart.com) became the talk of the town in EMC at Insead. 

How folks in Europe thought of it as a luxury brand was fun and fascinating to watch.",2025-11-11T06:47:15.661Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7393879710214184960,7393902112423706624)"
Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"My only issue is with the fact that inspite of selling a frame and lens at 2000, they use a cheaper and less quality raw materials to keep the ex factory cost at around 200. (According to the research done by the-ken). Even at 50% discount that is a gross margin of 80%. And still struggling to make profits. Does not make any sense to me",2025-11-11T06:20:01.772Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7393879710214184960,7393895259396689920)"
Ambar Raj,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ambarraj,Founder @Wild Oak | Building D2C Body-Care Brand | Carlson MBA’17 | Ex-Product & Strategy,"Completely agree on the customer experience and long term potential - no doubt Lenskart is building something strong. But valuation isn’t about whether they’ll grow or has great customer experience. It’s about how much of that growth is already priced in. 

How far into the future has the market already factored their growth? 5 years, 10, or 20?

When you invest as a VC in startups at very early stage, there is a chance revenues / profits can grow 10X, 100X even then they are not valued at 10X revenue normally. 

Just my opinion.",2025-11-11T06:16:40.122Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7393879710214184960,7393894413619400704)"

Ankit Singh,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ankitkalvi,"2x Founder | Tomorrow’s AI, Engineered today | GTM & B2B Partnerships Expert","What’s fascinating here is how Lenskart blurred the D2C and infra lines - they built a D2C brand on top of a B2B-grade supply chain. Almost feels like they IPO’d a platform, not a retailer. Curious if that’s what public investors will actually price in over time?
