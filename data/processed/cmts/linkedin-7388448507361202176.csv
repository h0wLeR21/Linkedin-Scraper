R Ramdas,https://www.linkedin.com/in/r-ramdas-b088036,Financial Advisor,"Once I attended a programme on “Negotiating Skills”. One of the questions put before us was ‘who do you think is the best negotiator?’
No one could give satisfactory response. The professor said, “your child is the best negotiator!”",2025-10-27T17:02:32.044Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388621132968579073)"

Also, at times, I've seen, if the other party is just not budging, it may be a good idea to introduce a new persona on the negotiating table. Somehow, same points, coming from an unfamiliar place, tend to make a lot more sense to the other party :) ",2025-10-27T09:10:59.449Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388502465232474112)"

Most people think negotiation is all about getting what you want only. 
I believe it is like a collaborative what other want try to understand it and find out how both come to the point both people win together. ",2025-10-27T07:38:43.191Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7388448507361202176,7388479244483452928)"

Fahad Fazil,https://www.linkedin.com/in/fahadfazil,Co-Founder & CTO | Building Devize — The Business OS for Modern Enterprises,"Avik Ashar This is such a refreshing and grounded take on negotiation — love how you connected Ricardo’s Comparative Advantage to everyday life 👏 The boarding school barter story adds the perfect personal touch (and humor!) while driving home the point that negotiation isn’t about dominance, it’s about alignment. The “win together” mindset is spot on — it’s the essence of long-term relationship building, whether in VC, startups, or life.
