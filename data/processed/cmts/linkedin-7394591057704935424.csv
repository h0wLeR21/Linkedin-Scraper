all those templates and case studies mean nothing if your first message sounds like it was written by a robot in 2003. personalization beats preparation every time.

Shubhankar Sharma (SS),https://www.linkedin.com/in/getshubhankar,Technology Enthusiast | IT Enterprise Solutions | Business Consulting | Views on LinkedIn are “Personal Views”,"Avik Ashar No doubt that US Big Techs or US Marketing dominates the world. 

I have a slightly different perspective.
Our brains are affected by #AmFluEnza and we are conditioned to think within those patterns they have established and normalized.
Because we are living in America or an ""American market"", we think that's inspiring.

Prof Philip Kotler's books are considered benchmark for marketing. 
He often talks about the 4Ps of Marketing, and recently he has given 6Ps lecture. 
Purpose, People, Partners, Peace, Planet, and Prosperity. 

The way Peace and Prosperity is interpreted in US is very different from many countries. 

Their case studies work well there, but how each geography is significantly different is often unsolved by them. 

Some of their big companies such as Ford, Harley and GM entered and miserably failed in the Indian market, while Japanese and Korean teams of Suzuki, Honda, Toyota Hyundai and Kia succeeded. 

If you break the pattern, like the Japanese and Korean do, there are limitless possibilities.",2025-11-13T06:43:36.050Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7394591057704935424,7394625967044005888)"

Neeraj Deshpande,https://www.linkedin.com/in/neeraj-deshpande,Building Platypus,"Avik Ashar Absolutely right, this was an eye opener for me when I had first made the move from an Indian organization to a US organization. The structure approach, maturity of communication, using past data and present trends to tailor the offer, and above all patience to keep chasing the deal instead of our Indian approach of harrassing sales people daily for numbers.
