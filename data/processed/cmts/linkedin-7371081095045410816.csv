Ramkumar R S,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsrinnovations,milliGOLD | RSR Innovations,"Long ago at Murugappa Group we were trained by Mercuri Goldman on Capital Equipment selling - and there was this ""fox hunting"" method of mapping gate keepers, influencers, users and decision makers and their relative outlook towards you and the competition and then using them to champion your cause - worked very well for us in large organizations and public sector enterprises.

Luckily for me, I was able to work with them when they moved to different organisations. Bless them for this. 

The most appealing part - when Founders are solving problems they've faced during their careers. I am working on solving - the biggest one to my knowledge is Closure, Client Retention.",2025-09-09T07:37:55.613Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7371081095045410816,7371084427373981696)"
