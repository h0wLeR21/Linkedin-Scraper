Nirupesh Joshi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nirupesh,Building a luxury watch brand from India.,"Avik, love the insights, find them valuable. One contradiction on this post though - FOs wary of long term capital blockage, but we need to create more IP and products, as opposed to cost arbitrage businesses. Building brands that create true IP and products take much longer than cost arbitrage models. How do we then expect to have capital not locked up for long?",2025-09-18T05:24:29.033Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7373948276565315584,7374312336137973760)"

Convincing LPs is often tougher than convincing customers, because the bets are bigger and the timelines longer. The real opportunity lies in backing IP-driven businesses that can ride global tailwinds, not just cost advantage.

Chris Block,https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchris,2×–5× Asset Rerate | Capital Physics™ ​> P&L Optics | M&A Lens: Compounders vs. Consumption Traps | Capital Yield Pricing Algorithm™ | Bloomberg of Venture Pricing,"The scoreboard broke when capital was treated as the product. Capital ≠ Leverage. Infrastructure = Leverage.

TVPI only looked good because ZIRP + cloud + mobile/social created near-perfect macro tailwinds. 

Buying growth and hoping for multiple expansion worked in that anomaly but it wasn’t real value creation.

DPI > TVPI has to become the new scoreboard. 

First-principles math: linear metrics extract founder equity and leak LP capital, while yield metrics compound both.

NRR is the classic trap—backward-looking and linear. Even strong NRR with low retention yield is a mispriced asset leaking founder equity and DPI. Retention yield is forward-looking and compounding.

When CIOs call for IP and product creation, isn’t that really a call to shift from linear optics to compounding yield systems?",2025-09-17T16:26:14.380Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7373948276565315584,7374116484568170496)"

I emphasize on how investors are interested in the product but also the defensibility of the business and thus Intellectual Property plays a very crucial role for setting up such landmines for competitors and making your business (pitch deck) really hard to pass on. And especially with firms who are in technology and making revenue and has global ambitions, it becomes all the more important. Imagine being invested in R&D for 7 years and creating something novel, only to open the gates for others to replicate it and also lower the benchmarks of the product itself.

That global uncertainty you mentioned reminds me of a call I recently had with a venture builder who had spoken to 332 investors that he knew personally or had warm intros.

They ended up raising a *quarter* of the amount they wanted to despite having a business doing twice as well as the average top quartile VC fund.",2025-09-17T07:28:52.674Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7373948276565315584,7373981253051740160)"
