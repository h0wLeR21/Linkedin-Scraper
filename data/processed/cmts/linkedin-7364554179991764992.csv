Shekhar Chatterjee,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekharchatterjee,Building PoloPan | AI x Consumer Tech x Commerce,"Venture Capital seems like one of the hardest businesses to crack. I think major problems snowball when the founder has tossed the liquidity event out of the window after getting the cheque - a major risk in blindside for funds - and the associated risks like erosion of entire investment capital/finding liquidity through other secondaries at a discount. 

A founder's need for more and more private capital erodes both capital and trust from the investing ecosystem. The ecosystem in India and the USA is entirely different. 

Being capital efficient early on + keen to drive towards a liquidity event = could help the VC maths better. 
Giving liquidity is the founder's responsibility, deciding to exit is an investor choice.",2025-09-16T05:51:32.219Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7364554179991764992,7373594368538169346)"

Believe if the market is large enough (as is the case with most sectors in India) and a founder has sharp market insights with a proven ability to build teams, it’s worth backing them — even if they don’t carry a 'VP Google India' tag.

If VCs aren’t willing to take this risk, LP capital might be better off in the stock markets, where returns are more visible.

Today, too much money is chasing 'star performers' at inflated valuations, while 'good performers (read strong operators)' at reasonable valuations — with far greater multiplier potential — are often overlooked. That’s why we’re seeing dry powder pile up in the ecosystem.

Apoorv Sharma,https://www.linkedin.com/in/aposh,Helping investors discover and invest in Venture Capital Funds | Ex-500Global | Ex-Oracle | Ex-AICGIM | Ex-IIMA Ventures,"Interesting rant, but let’s be honest, you left out the best part of the VC business model

For that ₹200 Cr fund, assuming a 2–20 structure and 10-year cycle, the fund will charge ~₹40 Cr in fees to LPs
By year 4, you are already raising a bigger ₹300 Cr+ fund, so fee income doubles quickly. Not a bad business model

With this fee, the promise to LPs is: “we’ll find the best opportunities, invest in them, & deliver outsized returns.” In practice, these returns are as mythical for most funds as unicorns

Now, if you think of yourself as a business, you actually have two stakeholders: LPs & startups. Since your revenue comes from startups (exits, upside), they are essentially your customers. Dismissing early founders because of “lack of brand” or""story"" (seriously!) feels more like lazy customer service than risk-taking.

When a fund insists on only backing pedigreed founders, it usually signals poor groundwork & a lack of conviction in its own thesis. It’s the equivalent of saying, “I’ll only buy stocks that some big-shot investor is buying, because I don’t trust my own judgment.” 

That’s also how we end up with bloated valuations & overfunded darlings where governance takes a backseat, something the ecosystem has already seen.",2025-08-22T15:43:12.083Z,"urn:li:comment:(activity:7364554179991764992,7364683569119588353)"
